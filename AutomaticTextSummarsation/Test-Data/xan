day captain ahead of the world cup\nâ we can look back at everything\nme and cooky have spoken and i âve gone through a lot with alastair cook\nhe was disappointed not to go , it did nât work out , but we âve got to look forward now\nwe can go no further than the next five weeks\nâ i really think we âve got to keep it simple\nthere âs been a lot of noise around english cricket and a lot of emotion which is understandable but i think now we âve got 16 players who are going to the west indies under alastair cook and we âve got to go and try to play some really good cricket\nâ new chairman colin graves , who has heaped pressure on england by encouraging kevin pietersen to return to county cricket , caused another stir when he called west indies mediocre and said there would be an inquiry if england failed to win\nand peter moores acknowledged that jobs are on the line in the caribbean\nboth alastair cook and peter moores were keen to talk about the squad and not about kevin pietersen â from my point of view it âs not about the coach\nit âs about the players , it âs about winning and it âs about english cricket\nwe âve got a very committed bunch of players and support staff who desperately want to win for england\nso i âm going no further than the next five weeks when we âve got three tests against tough opposition\nif we do well we âll get some momentum going into what is a very big summer\nso that âs got to be the focus , on playing the right sort of cricket because that âs what the fans want\nbut has he been given any assurance over his position and those of others ? â no , it does nât work like that , â said peter moores\nâ i think we all know we âre in a results business\ntom and colin graves have come in and tom has been great since he âs been here\nfor me i âm just focusing on what âs in front of us\nâ for me and alastair it âs pretty clear\nwe âve got some new players coming in and we âve got jonathan trott coming back\nwe âve got to make sure that the side moulds quickly\nwe âve got a couple of practice games and we go straight into the test series and we do nât need to go any further than that\nâ he knows , though , that his job will probably not go any further than the west indies if england fail to win\nand kevin pietersen will be a constant presence in the background piling on the pressure\nexperienced batsman jonathan trott returns to the side after suffering from situational anxiety", "labels": "1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0", "summaries": "england departed for west indies tour from gatwick on thursday\nengland will play two warm -

good humour\n' well , soccer 's being doing quite well for about 150 years now and if you look at the amount of people who play and watch it 's still doing quite well , so i do n't really see a need , ' he replies with a patient smile\nheath has been here for eight years now and witnessed the process at first hand , going from the backwoods of the usl to the major leagues that orlando city have been elevated to this season\nthe years have not dimmed heath 's impish enthusiasm and , now 53 , he speaks of the game 's expansion with an almost missionary zeal\nperched in the morning sunshine on a bench at manchester city 's pristine training facility he talks about the upside of salary caps , what frank lampard and steven gerrard can expect , the humility of his star signing kaka and his hopes of an eventual rivalry with david 's troubled miami project\nsteven gerrard will join la galaxy in the summer after spending 17 seasons at liverpool midfielder frank lampard has signed a two - year contract with new york city the aforementioned names ' imminent arrival is just one reason why the mls is achieving a greater resonance on the other side of the atlantic\n' i think england people are fascinated with united states , ' says heath\n' you see the baseball , american football and basketball and wonder whether football can take off here\ni 'm glad to say i think the only question is how big it becomes\n' perhaps we have slowly had to educate some of the media\none of the things that has kept football down a bit is that some of the high profile media have n't known the sport , and maybe some people are scared of it\nthey guard their own sports quite carefully\n' heath 's stateside adventure began in the unlikely setting of a pub in his native newcastle under lyme , where he bumped into stoke city director phil rawlins\nkaka is playing out the final days of a distinguished career on the doorstep of disney ' he was looking to invest in soccer over here and i had just lost my job at coventry\ni 'd been with coventry to portland that year for a pre-season friendly and there were 15,000 people there\ni thought the game was taking off and so i thought i 'd try and get in early\n' i started off at the bottom in the usl in austin , texas\nsometimes there were less than 1,000 people in the ground , not great facilities , lot of college kids , but you could see the game growing\n' now you look at seattle sounders and they would be not that far from man united and arsenal in average gates , getting 45,000 per game\n' his belief that in ten years the mls will be world 's ' third or fourth biggest league ' is fuelled by his daily influx of emails : ' i only have to open my inbox every day to see how many people want to come out here\nall the time agents are offering me players who are going to be out of contract in two years ' time , big international players who will may be be 29 then\n' orlando city midfielder kaka has the highest salary in mls history while david is still looking for a ground in miami â last month he made an unusually low profile visit in further efforts to resolve the issue â orlando city sold out their opening game last month at the temporary home of the citrus bowl\n' we got 62,000 our first game\nthat will not be sustained but we are building a 21,000 seater stadium with the capability of going up to 28,000 and we will fill that\n' it helps having kaka as the club 's marquee signing , a superstar in name but evidently not in behaviour , as heath quickly discovered : ' we went on pre-season to charleston and we hired a few vans to transport everyone around\nhe volunteered to drive one of them and then would wait around for the kids who are straggling and the last to leave , to make sure they 're not left behind\nhe 's a remarkable person\n' he knows what an impact the involvement of david could also have if he can sort problems out 250 miles south , and admits a vested interest : ' i think he has faced an uphill battle on the back of what happened with the baseball there\nthe city invested millions into the marlins and they were n't happy with how it worked out with the owner\nmidfielder heath scored 71 goals in 226 games for everton ' there 's nobody at this club that does n't want to see david get it off the ground in miami\nrivalry makes sports , and we could get that going with miami and maybe atlanta

improvement\n' i earned more money going to spain , one of the reasons we do n't export any more from england is that we are the gravy train\nif you want to earn a lot of money you stay in england\nif you go back to the likes of me , mark hateley , glenn hoddle , michael robinson , the truth is we all went for more money\nbut it does help you learn\n' now he is doing something very unusual , having to effectively build a team from scratch after orlando city 's ' promotion ' , working all the time within the salary cap\nthey currently lie third in the eastern conference after six games\n' the

so there is a lot of juggling\n' heath never gets homesick , and there is a constant flow of football people passing through from england , usually taking their children to disneyland\n' the funny

with the strain on the broaches of the tunic show it was worn by someone overweight\n' this also proves it was worn for a long , long time by someone who was fat enough to cause it to stretch and wear

get materials and quality everywhere went down\n' there was also an effort by goering to appear less grand during the latter part of the war\nthis is because as he was going around meeting the
