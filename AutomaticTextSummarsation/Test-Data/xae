and expand our presence into the solar system\nâ the destroyed earth was big for me , â said mr frank mckeever\nâ i began thinking about the possibility of being hit by an asteroid - especially with the fact that a huge one just flew awfully close to us a few days ago\nâ another poster shows humans living on the surface of mars in cities , which frank mckeever says he thinks is â very possible â\nhe added : â i can see that happening in my lifetime\nand i think it should\n' on mercury -

to provide key evidence for this potentially habitable band\neuropa , meanwhile , has often been said to be a potential place to find life in the solar system - and mr frank mckeever has imagined we might live there one day , too\nnasa is in the process of designing its unmanned europa clipper spacecraft , which would arrive at the moon of jupiter in the 2020s and fly through geysers erupting from its surface\nusing specialised instruments , it might be able to detect life in an underground ocean -

that followed by an afternoon tea with ' at least two kinds of sandwiches ' at four\nfor supper , the queen has more fish or game such as pheasant sent to windsor from her estate at sandringham or balmoral\nperhaps this hearty but plain fare explains her continuing good health and her ability to manage what remains a heavy workload meetings : she meets the uk pm once a week and ' regularly speaks ' to those elsewhere role : the queen performing her role as queen of australia with a visit to an aboriginal culture show in 2002 state opening : queen , here as queen of new zealand , opening parliament in wellington in 1977 patriotic : queen , here of great britain and northern ireland , meeting children in hampshire her majesty spends most afternoons welcoming incoming ambassadors to buckingham palace , presiding over investitures or , as she did last week , taking part in visits on behalf of one of the 16 countries of which she is head of state\nshe also has a weekly audience with the uk prime minister , currently david cameron , and ' speaks regularly ' to the prime ministers of the 15 other countries where she is head of state , among them australian 's tony abbott and canada 's stephen harper\nunder the queen , the monarchy has also modernised and embraces the latest technology , including social media\nthe queen is currently the world 's most followed royal , with her account , @ britishmonarchy , followed by 970,000 people\nher first post , an anodyne comment about the opening of an exhibition at the science museum , went viral -

best in the division and only two behind diego costa , sergio aguero and harry kane who are with clubs at the other end of the table\nit seems inevitable austin will move on should rangers get relegated\nliverpool need a natural goalscorer with rickie lambert and mario balotelli set to leave in the summer while spurs do n't want to be over-reliant on harry kane\ncharlie austin is only a couple of goals short of the league 's leading scorers and is a target for liverpool spurs are also interested in the england striker as they look for a partner for harry kane up front saido berahino ( baggies ) wanted by : spurs valued at : Â£ 15m the england under 21 striker has made headlines for the wrong reasons this season and received a 12 -

gatherers in the mesolithic to early farmers in the neolithic , with the basic assumption that the arrival of farming significantly altered the biology of those first farmers , after which they gradually developed into the europeans of today\n' but from ancient dna it now looks like the first farmers in mainland europe were still relatively dark -
