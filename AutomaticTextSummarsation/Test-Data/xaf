{"doc": "an israel geologist claims he has â confirmed â the existence and authenticity of a tomb belonging to jesus and his son in jerusalem\nafter extensive chemical tests , dr shimron says he has linked the james ossuary â a 1st - century chalk box that some believe hold the bones of jesus ' brother â to the long disputed â jesus family tomb â in the city âs talpiot neighbourhood\nthe research could have enormous ramifications as it suggests that jesus was married , fathered a child and that a physical resurrection did not take place\ndr shimron âs work has renewed controversy over the talpiot tomb , which was discovered in 1980 and dates back to the second temple period and the time of jesus , the jerusalem post reported\nbones were discovered inside ossuaries , including one that bore the inscription , â jesus , son of joseph '\nothers included the names maria , joseph , mary , yose , matthew and most controversially , â judah , son of jesus â\njoseph , mary and jesus were all common names at the time and a statistician from the university of toronto said that they each made up eight per cent of the population\nhowever , a very small percentage would have had the same family name combination as described in the bible\ndr shimron âs work has renewed the controversy over the talpiot tomb , which was found in 1980 and dates back to the second temple period and the time of jesus ( a portrait is pictured ) the long - disputed long disputed â jesus family tomb â in the city âs talpiot neighbourhood ( marked ) and is now sealed beneath a concrete slab after building work took place some years ago probing this connection , dr shimron and documentary maker jacobovici looked closer at the ossuaries , including the james ossuary , which is held by a private owner and bears the inscription , â james , son of joseph , brother of jesus â\nthe james ossuary is a first century chalk example of a box that was used to hold the bones of the dead\nbut it stands out because it bears the inscription ' james , son of joseph , brother of jesus ' on one side\nthe inscription is considered significant because it may provide archaeological evidence of jesus , the existence of the ossuary was announced in 2002 , but its authenticity was immediately challenged\nthe box 's owner was charged with forging part of the inscription and while he was found innocent seven years later , the judge said the acquittal ' does not mean that the inscription on the ossuary is authentic or that it was written 2,000 years ago '\nnow , dr shimron claims the chemical signature on the â crust â of the box matches that of a tomb in jerusalem known as the â jesus family tomb â where other ossuaries were found bearing the names of jesus and mary as well as â judah , son of jesus â\nthe owner of the ossuary , oded golan , was accused of forging the inscription shortly after its discovery by an academic from the sorbonne in paris , but he was later found innocent\nother experts and archaeologists have rejected the claim that the jerusalem tomb is connected with jesus at all\nrecently dr shimron gained access to the james ossuary and scraped beneath the box 's patina , the layer that forms on metal over time\nhe ran around 150 tests on the chemistry of samples from 25 different ossuaries â 15 of which were from unrelated tombs â and found that traces of magnesium , iron and silicon from the james ossuary matched the chemical signature of talpiot tomb\nthe talpiot ossuaries were covered in a thick layer of â rendzina â soil , which is characteristic of the hills of jerusalem when they were found and has a unique chemistry\ndr shimron worked from the assumption that an earthquake of 363ad flooded the tomb with soil and mud to cover the ossuaries , effectively forming a vacuum and freezing them in time\nsoil that seeped into the box matched that found in the talpiot ossuaries , indicating that it had lain for years alongside others in the â holy â location\nbones were discovered there in ossuaries , or chalk boxes , including one that bears the inscription , â jesus , son of joseph ' with others bearing the names of maria , joseph , mary , yose , matthew and most controversially , â judah , son of jesus â\nhere an inscription that says ' yoseph ' on an ossuary because bones were found in the ossuaries , it could be argued that there was no bodily resurrection ( portrayed in this tapestry ) which is the belief of more traditional christians , while others accept the event was spiritual jesus was not a real person and is probably the result of a combination of stories about several different individuals , according to a writer and leading atheist activist\nfitzgerald , a san francisco based author , believes he has compiled compelling evidence that proves jesus did not exist\nhe claims there are no contemporary mentions of jesus in historical accounts from the time when he was supposed to have lived , yet other jewish sect leaders from the time do appear\njesus was not a real person and is probably the result of a combination of stories about several different individuals , according to a writer and leading atheist activist\na mosaic of jesus is shown he also points to discrepancies in the early gospels of mark , matthew and luke , claiming these were written decades after the supposed time of jesus\ninstead he insists the disciples of jesus were also probably not real and their names only later attached to the gospels to lend them credence\nspeaking to mailonline , he said : ' there is a paradox that jesus did all these amazing things and taught all these amazing things yet no one heard of him outside his immediate cult for nearly 100 years\n' or it means he did n't do all these things at all\n' the first gospel of christians appears to have been a literary allegory that were written decades after the time they portray\n' i believe that christians started as one of the many mystery faiths that appeared at the time where old gods and old traditions were rebooted\n' christians appears to have been a jewish mystery faith\nfitzgerald told mailonline : ' there is a paradox that jesus did all these amazing things and taught all these amazing things yet no one heard of him outside his immediate cult for nearly 100 years '\nthe famous statue of christ the redeemer in rio de janeiro , brazil , is shown ' by the time of paul there appears to have been plenty of different \" lord 's suppers \" as he complains about the existence of other gospels and messiahs\n' it appears that early christians managed to take the stories from these other faiths and incorporate them into the story of jesus\n' mr fitzgerald said : ' there is nothing implausible to think that jesus was a real person , but i just do n't think that he can have been a single person if he existed at all\n' we also have no mention of jesus in other historical texts from the time\nthere were certainly people writing about judea at the time like philo of alexandria\n' during this period there were many other messiahs and wannabe messiahs who did far less exciting things than jesus , but all of them managed something jesus did not - to make a dent on the historical record\n' two billion people believe all these miracles happened yet there is no evidence they did\n' jacobovici told the jerusalem post : â this find illustrates that the james ossuary is authentic and the jesus family tomb indeed belongs to the family of jesus\nâ dr shumron told the new york times : â i think i âve got really powerful , virtually unequivocal evidence that the james ossuary spent most of its lifetime , or death time , in the

a fold in the brain that appears to coordinate facial perception and memory\nprosopagnosia can result from stroke , traumatic brain injury , or some neurodegenerative diseases\nin some cases the condition is congenital , and present at birth\nit appears to run in families , which makes it likely to be the result of a genetic mutation or deletion\nsome degree of prosopagnosia is often found in children with autism and asperger 's syndrome\ntreatment of the condition focuses on helping sufferers develop compensatory strategies , including relying on voice recognition , clothing , or unique physical attributes\nsource : national institute of neurological disorders and stroke mrs natalie whitear , mother to daughters mia , eight , and eva , three , first became aware of her condition when her boss noticed she was unable to remember people she 'd met before\nshe said : ' about two or three years ago my boss took me to one side and told me i needed to be more careful with remembering people 's names\n' he said that he 'd seen me introduce myself to people i 'd known for years , and asking who they were\n' i explained to him that i could remember their names , but not their faces - it was only because of his shocked reaction that i suddenly realised that this was not normal\n' i found a test on the internet that asked you to recognise celebrities ' faces and i failed\n' i was then contacted by a psychologist at bournemouth university who diagnosed me with prosopagnosia , and suddenly everything made sense\n' looking back , mrs natalie whitear realises that the condition has affected her throughout her life\nshe said : ' when i look back , there have always been signs of the condition but i never even realised\n' i never had posters of famous people on my bedroom wall because i did n't know what they looked like\n' people would say that they 'd stood next to me at a queue in the supermarket but i 'd ignored them , or i 'd walked past friends in the street\n' i 've also always been a nightmare when it comes to watching tv -

i 've never known any different\n' dr sarah bate , from the centre for face processing disorders at bournemouth university , has carried out research into prosopagnosia\nshe said : ' it is a cognitive condition characterised by an impairment in face recognition\n' very rarely some people acquire the condition following neurological trauma , but we 've recently become aware that many more people have a developmental form of prosopagnosia\n' these people have never suffered any neurological damage , and appear to have simply failed to develop the visual mechanisms that are required for face processing\n' sometimes the condition appears to run in families , and often people report other first -

{"doc": "the arrival of an advanced group of modern humans in europe 40,000 years ago played a role in the demise of neanderthals , scientists have claimed\nneanderthals were the dominant human species in europe and much of asia for around 250,000 years before vanishing entirely 41,000 years ago\nnow scientists have found proof that a group of modern humans known as the protoaurignacian culture arrived in southern europe at around the same time the neanderthals disappeared\nscientists took ct scans of teeth found at riparo bombrini in western ligurian alps ( left ) and in the grotta di fumane in western lessini mountains ( right ) , both in italy , and found they belonged to ancestors of modern humans who were part of a group known as the protoaurignacian culture they have been able to conclusively show that a pair of ancient baby teeth found at two prehistoric sites in northern italy belong to modern humans from this culture\nit has settled a debate that has raged since they were discovered in 1976 , and later in 1992 , over whether the teeth and other artefacts found with them were neanderthal or homo sapien in origin\nan incisor found in riparo bombrini in western ligurian alps in 1976 , and an upper incisor found in 1992 , in the grotta di fumane in the western lessini mountains in italy are among only three remains thought to have belonged to the protoaurignacian culture - an early group of humans\ndr benazzi and his colleagues at the cnr institute of clinical physiology in pisa , italy , whose work is published in the journal science , used ct scans of a tooth found in riparo bombrini\nthey found that the enamel on the crown of the teeth was thicker than that found on neanderthals teeth and it was more similar in morphology to modern humans\nradio carbon dating also showed that it was 40,000 years old\nusing advanced scanning and dna analysis , researchers have now been able to prove that these teeth belonged to protoaurignacian humans and are the oldest modern human remains in europe\nthey suggest it was the arrival of this modern human culture that marked a turning point in humanity âs evolution and led to the rapid disappearance of neanderthals in the face of their more advanced cousins\nthe aurignacian culture that followed the arrival of these first modern humans produced the world âs earliest known musical instruments and the oldest wall art. they also produced advanced bone and antler based weapons , and are thought to have been behind a 40,000 - year - old sculpture known as the lion man\ndr benazzi , an archaeologist at the university of bologna in italy said : â what the results mean is that these two teeth represent the oldest europe modern human fossils currently associated with an aurignacian - related archaeological context\nâ human fossil material is very rare , particularly well preserved deciduous teeth\nâ this finding suggests that the arrival of our species on the continent might have triggered the demise of neanderthals , which likely disappeared around 39,000 years ago\nâ there are very few archaeological remains of the protoaurignacian culture from when they arrived in europe\nthe baby teeth , found at two sites in north italy shown above , are two of just three protoaurignacian remains using advanced scanning and dna analysis , researchers have proved the teeth belonged to this culture and that they are the oldest modern human remains in europe\nthey suggest it was the arrival of this modern human culture ( infant skull pictured left ) led to the rapid disappearance of neanderthals ( skull pictured right ) this fragment bird bone was engraved by inhabitants of a rock shelter at riparo bombrini in north west italy and is now known to have been made by the first modern humans in europe who arrived 40,000 years ago ct scans of the incisor found at riparo bombrini ( above ) showed it had thicker enamel than neanderthals teeth and it was more similar in morphology to modern humans\nradio carbon dating also showed that it was 40,000 years old an incisor found in riparo bombrini in western ligurian alps in 1976 , and an upper incisor found in 1992 , in the grotta di fumane in the western lessini mountains in italy were among only three remains that thought to have belonged to this early group of humans\nthey are often depicted as dim - witted evolutionary losers , but neanderthals were not driven to extinction by their lack of brains\ninstead , it is more likely that they disappeared 40,000 years ago because of interbreeding and assimilation with our early modern human ancestors , scientists believe\nan analysis of archaeological evidence dating back 200,000 years strips away some of the myths surrounding neanderthals and reveals they were more advanced and sophisticated than has widely been thought\nmany researchers believe the differences between the two human species are not enough on their own to account for the demise of the neanderthals\nneanderthals have been found to make stone tools and even made jewellery\neight talons taken from a white -

{"doc": "it might not sound very romantic\nbut ditching the idea that we should we should marry for life could help many of us have happier relationships , according to a marriage therapist\na fixed - term starter marriage , in which couples sign a renewable contract - known as a ' wedlease ' - would work better for many couples , argues pease gadoua\na relationship expert has suggested that a renewable marriage contract known as a ' wedlease ' would work better for many modern day couples and avoid increasing divorces in her new book , the new i do , which was co-written with vicki larson , she claims that the traditional marriage model in our modern - day culture ' sets up too many people for failure '\nso , instead of promising ' til death do us part ' , couples in a starter marriage agree to be together for ' two , three , four or more years â whatever works for you and your partner '\nat the end of the stated contract period , the couple decide whether they want to go their separate ways , or continue with the marriage , at which point they should draw up a revised contract\n' a starter marriage is a short - term contract for couples to ' try on ' the institution to see if it fits â without bringing children into the mix â before jumping into a life - long contract , ' mrs pease gadoua said\n' we have learner 's permits for driving , we have internships before starting careers and we have probationary or modifiable contracts in many other business negotiations , yet the greatest and most in - depth legal contract that most of us will ever enter requires that you commit to one person forever with precious little information about what it will entail\n' relationship counsellor susan pease gadoua says that traditional weddings set people up for failure the starter marriage can be an improvement on the traditional marital model because ' each spouse will need to be paying closer attention to his or her actions and stick to what was agreed to , lest his or her partner decides not to renew a few years down the road ' , the 53 year old claims\nand if the couple do decide to part , the separation should be more amicable than other divorces might be and reduce the odds of individuals feeling like they have ' failed ' , she adds\n' because a starter marriage by its nature avoids the drama that typically goes along with a marital dissolution , you and your former spouse will more likely be able to sit down and compare notes about what worked and what did n't\n' if the couple stay together , the new contract could be amended to fit another of the specific marital models that mrs pease gadoua advocates\nfor example , if they want children , they could sign a ' parenting marriage ' contract ( couples should remain childless while in a starter marriage ' because it 's a bad idea to ' try on ' marriage with young lives in the balance ' ) , with new rules and goals\nor if monogamy proved a challenge during the starter marriage , an open marriage contract ' might be an attractive option ' , she said\nbut mrs pease gadoua , who got married at the age of 43 , stresses that the starter marriage is not about just marrying anyone for the sake of being married , and it does n't mean that you should marry in the hope of it ending by a certain time â ' you 're just not going to vow ' until death do us part ' , ' she said\npease gadoua 's book the new ' i do ' explores alternatives to the traditional nuptials and , the american claims , despite its temporary nature , a starter marriage is not the same as cohabiting\nnot only does marriage give you more legal and financial protection , couples often have different expectations while living together , and roles can be confused\nshe also claims friends , families , and society view cohabiters differently , with fewer people regarding them as a family unit when unmarried\ncouples can also slide into living together with completely different expectations , she warns\none of the pair may see it as a way of saving on living expenses while the other assumes it 's a stepping stone to marriage\na starter marriage can ' help couples align expectations , create a plan of what each partner will contribute to the marriage , clarify goals and strategize what will happen if one or both do n't want to renew the contract , ' she said\na typical contract would cover areas such as finances , sex ( amount , and views on monogamy ) , career priorities , and even how free time should be spent ( with specific rules about visiting in - laws )\n' if you want to explore what being married is like , living together wo n't really give you the answer , ' she said\n' having a starter marriage with a contract , however , will\n' and it will make you smarter and more prepared for either the renewal of your marital contract or a new marriage with a new partner\n' she does admit however , that limited term marriages will be unthinkable for many\n' marriage should be considered ' successful ' by what it has accomplished , not by how long it lasts , ' she said\n' if people are going to continue to see marriage that way , then , yes â a renewable contract is going to create quite a bit of angst for many of them\n' but harry benson , research director at marriage foundation , the think - tank which champions marriage , said the idea of a starter marriage ' undermines commitment ' and reduces it to a ' business contract '\n' the basic premise of commitment is to make a plan for an indefinite future together , ' he said\n' anything less than that is a business contract\n' without such a clear view of the future , there is no need to sacrifice , to forgive , to prioritise one another , all of which are fundamental characteristics of a successful relationship\n' most importantly , commitment is about giving up other choices\nif i choose you , i have stopped choosing others\n' that unconditional choice sends a signal that provides clarity , intent , and removes ambiguity\n' setting a time limit utterly undermines commitment and sabotages it from the very beginning\n' all relationships are difficult because all of us are different\n' even if a little over a third of marriages fail , most last for life\nsuccess stories outside of marriage are the exception\n' the idea of a starter marriage might hold superficial appeal\nbut it is ultimately doomed to failure because it runs contrary to human nature\n' everyone wants reliable love\nlimited term contracts are n't the way to do it\n' divorces are most likely to occur between the fourth and eight wedding anniversary , with half of all divorces happening in the first 10 years of marriage , according to the office for national statistics\nif you do n't fancy a starter marriage , here are some of mrs pease gadoua 's other alternatives â¦ parenting marriage : main aim is to provide a loving , stable home for children\ncouple do not have to be in love\ntime -
