{"doc": "no matter how young or old we are , most of us experience the odd memory lapse\nperhaps it will be forgetting where you put the car keys , or what you went to get from upstairs\nthankfully , these moments pass\nbut for those with dementia there is no such relief\nimagine what it 's like being unable to recall what you 'd done an hour before\nor not remembering how to navigate around your own house or the names of your nearest and dearest\nor knowing what everyday things are for , such as a fridge\ntoday , in the third part of our major good health series on dementia , we look at ways to help minimise the impact of these memory problems , to prolong independence and help those with dementia live as full a life as possible\nrecently , scientists have found out why\nduring deep sleep , brain waves move memories from the hippocampus - the area of the brain that is involved in short - term memory - to the prefrontal cortex at the front of the brain , where long - term memories are stored\nif this does n't happen , short - term memories get overwritten with new ones and the consequence is forgetfulness , according to researchers at the university of california , berkeley\nit is a common misconception that we need less sleep as we get older - in fact we need just as much , the problem is that older people find it harder to reach a deeper sleep\ngetting a good night 's sleep can be especially difficult for those with dementia , especially those with alzheimer 's disease who may experience changes to their sleeping patterns\nquite why this happens is not understood , but it may be related to the impact the condition has on the brain\nbut there are steps that can make it easier\none of the most important measures is to avoid catnapping during the day ( this becomes harder to avoid as dementia becomes more advanced )\ncatnapping makes it both harder to fall asleep at night and more likely you 'll wake up earlier than desired\nother steps include avoiding caffeine - coffee or tea - in the evening\na regular bedtime is also important as this gives the body the cues it needs to feel sleepy at set times , making it easier to fall asleep\nalthough many people believe a nightcap will help them sleep , alcohol is counter-productive and tends to make you wake in the night\nit is a diuretic and , therefore , you are likely to wake up needing to go to the loo\nit is also known to reduce the amount of the night you spend in deep , restorative sleep\nregularly eating food high in fat and sugar leads to inflammation in the hippocampus eating too much junk food : cakes , chips and biscuits wo n't just impact on the waistline - they can adversely affect your memory , too\nrecent research has found that regularly eating food high in fat and sugar leads to inflammation in the hippocampus\nscientists at the university of new south wales , australia , found that eating these foods every day caused inflammation in the brain after just one week\nthe work was done on rats , but it is thought the principle could extend to humans\nsmoking : many studies have found that even occasional smoking can impact on the brain\none study , from king 's college london , analysed 8,000 over- 50s and found that smokers performed worst in memory tests , learning ability and reasoning\nwhy this happens is thought to be linked to the fact that smoking reduces the amount of oxygen that reaches the brain\nthose who have smoked have also been shown to have greater overall shrinkage of the brain\nnot ' using it ' : when someone is diagnosed with dementia , they often start to withdraw from their normal hobbies and activities\nyet to retain your mental ability and memory skills for as long as possible you need to keep the brain stimulated\nthink of it this way : just as our bodies need physical exercise in order to stay as strong as possible so , too , do our brains\nit 's a tried - and - tested principle : for example , a review of 15 studies by the respected cochrane library looked at the benefits of a variety of activities designed to stimulate the brain and promote memory such as word games , puzzles , listening to music and practical activities such as baking and indoor gardening\nthe studies involved 718 participants with dementia - some took part in these activities and others did not\nafter between one and three months those who 'd taken part in the brain stimulating and practical activities did better on cognitive function tests than those who did not\ntips to help with a failing memory a failing short - term memory is a characteristic of dementia and can make it difficult to cope with day - to - day life\nthe following strategies may help : one of the most important measures is to avoid catnapping during the day have set meal times , as these are easier to remember - and write them down on a whiteboard to help recall what time is meal time\nthe mediterranean type of diet may be most beneficial as it 's been shown to maintain the health of the blood vessels , and keeping a healthy circulation is key for people with dementia as it ensures a healthy flow of blood to the brain\ntry to include oily fish such as trout , salmon or mackerel three times a week : the latest research suggests this is a good way to stop brain shrinkage\nthese fish contain omega - 3 fatty acids and research has found that people with the highest level of these have less shrinkage in the hippocampus , the area associated with memory\nto confirm a diagnosis of dementia or to access specialist services , a gp can refer a patient to a memory clinic\nnormally , these are based either at a community clinic or at a hospital\nthey will have a team of psychologist nurses and doctors\nas well as running tests that can help provide a diagnosis , they co-ordinate a range of services to help the dementia patient\nfor example , all clinics will offer cognitive stimulation therapy\nthis takes the form of group activities and exercises the patient is invited to attend twice a week for seven weeks\nthese activities could involve word games or even singing and have been found to help improve language skills and comprehension\neach session lasts for about 45 minutes\nyou can not simply attend a clinic -

no one will be held responsible\nms ana figueroa referenced other new york city incidents such as a crane collapse in 2008 that killed two and a fire in 2010 where those judged responsible faced manslaughter charges\nthe owner of the crane company and three men connected to the 2010 fire were all acquitted\nshe knows that the odds of a criminal conviction are small , but hopes that those responsible will help establish a small park on the property in memory of her son , who loved nature and meditating\nthe grieving mother said that those responsible include con edison , the utilities

to daily mail online saying : ' we said on the day of the explosion and since then , that our thoughts and prayers are with the victims of this tragedy , and we made a significant contribution to the

company told the new york times\nmrs ana figueroa said that illegal gas tapping should not be a ' three strike ' policy and that gas to the building should have been shut off completely following the second failed inspection\na con edison spokesman told daily mail online that the march 26 inspection was on ' work the building owner was doing in connection with the installation of a new service '\nthe spokesman said ' the work did not pass the inspection and our inspectors left\nthe new service was locked , meaning that gas could not be accessed by it\n' a plumber allegedly admitted to law enforcement earlier this month that he had created an illegal gas connection at the site of the explosion smoke from the fire was visible from around new york city as firefighters worked to combat the blaze on march 26 the investigation into the incident by police and fire authorities is ongoing , with much of the suspicion falling on the buildings ' gasworks con edison has previously said that it was replacing a small pipe with a larger one that would allow both the building residents and the sushi restaurant to receive gas\nrestaurant owner hyeonil kim told the new york times he believed that the residents had been getting gas since the summer from a pipe coming from ms hyrnenko 's other building next door\ngas is thought to have still been flowing through the old piping after the inspectors left\nafter the inspectors left , ms hrynenko 's son michael was down in the basement investigating a gas leak during the explosion\nhe was carried out by a general contractor with him\n' our understanding is that the criminal investigation continues , ' the company said in a statement\nfor now the mother is left with only pictures and messages from her son\nher last texts from nicholas , with whom she would talk about ' everything ' including include message where he asks her to cook his favorite chicken for dinner\nthe young man had just gotten his bachelor 's from buffalo state college and had been home for three months before he died\nright before meeting his blind date at sushi park , nicholas , a former model , had texted that he was about to have an ' interesting experience '\nms ana figueroa did not hear from her son again , and was knew that he was in the blast when she saw that his debit card had been used at the restaurant right before the explosion\nafter

on a level , say experts , with childbirth\nthe stones often remain symptomless while they 're in the kidney\nthey start causing pain - known as renal colic - once they travel down the ureter , the narrow tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder\n' renal colic is caused by the stone suddenly blocking the ureter , ' says mr ajayi , consultant urological surgeon at the hospital of st john & st elizabeth , london\nthe pain often comes on suddenly and can cause the patient to ' writhe around in agony ' , he adds\nthe pain can be intense enough to cause nausea and vomiting\nonce on the move , a stone can take days or weeks to travel out of the body\nin that time , it may cause persistent or intermittent pain in the back , groin or side , a need to urinate more than usual , and pain when urinating\nsometimes , if a stone blocks the exit of urine from the kidney , it can lead to a build - up of bacteria and trigger a kidney infection\nsigns of this include a fever , shivering , extreme weakness , diarrhoea , or cloudy and bad - smelling urine\nthe bad news is that the number of people developing troublesome stones is rocketing\nemergency admissions to hospital for kidney stones have shot up during the past decade by 136 per cent , according to official figures , rising from just above 5,000 to almost 12,000 per year\nmeanwhile , the number of people going in for planned non-emergency treatment for stones has almost doubled in the same period , rising from 26,666 in 2004 to 51,340\nthe cause for his condition , doctors believe , was low fluid intake and bizarrely , it may be that healthier lifestyles - doing tough workouts at the gym , and then not drinking enough , or shunning carbohydrates - are partly to blame , and may be why cases are going up , especially among women\n' more men than women used to suffer from kidney stones , with a ratio of about three to one , ' says mr ajayi\n' but an increasing number of women now get them , and the ratio is evening up\n' the main cause of kidney stones is dehydration\n' your kidneys are your waste - disposal system , ' explains dr kathryn griffith , the royal college of gps ' clinical champion for kidney care\n' they discard all the waste chemicals produced by your body , and they can do this efficiently if enough liquid is drunk to help flush them through\n' but if you become dehydrated , you overload the kidneys with urine that has a high concentration of stone - forming chemicals , and these begin to bind together to build stones\n' to avoid this , you need to drink enough to ensure your urine is ' the colour of white wine ' , says griffith - around 1.2 litres a day\nyou need more during hot weather or after exercise\nchanging diet trends are also pushing the figures up\n' there has been a trend , especially in people either wanting to lose weight or bulk up muscle , to eat low - carb , high - protein diets , ' says dr griffith\n' the animal proteins found in meat and fish break down into a waste chemical called uric acid ( a known stone - former ) in your urine\nthey also reduce the amount of citrate ( a stone - inhibitor )\n' this can lead to uric acid stones forming , especially if you also do n't drink enough fluid to assist the kidneys in their disposal job\n' there are other causes , too\nyour kidneys remove sodium , which is the main component of salt , from your body\nwhen they do this , they excrete calcium , too\nbut low - carb diets could also put you at risk so the more salt you eat , the more calcium you will have in your urine , which can build into stones\nobesity is another risk factor\n' obese people are more likely to have insulin resistance ( where the body ca n't use insulin effectively ) , ' says mr ajayi\nthis causes a change to the nature of urine , making it more acidic , which increases the risk of uric acid stones forming in the kidney\neating excessive amounts of oxalate is another culprit , as it can lead to the formation of calcium oxalate stones - the most common kind\noxalate - rich foods include tea , spinach , rhubarb , nuts , strawberries , beetroot and chocolate\nthey are all fine in moderation , but avoid large daily quantities\nif you have more than two urinary tract infections within a short space of time , you should ask your gp for an ultrasound to rule out a less common kind of kidney stone called struvite stones , which are caused by a build - up of bacteria from repeated urinary tract infections , adds dr griffith\nvirtually all stones under 5 mm in diameter can be passed naturally , with only prescription - strength pain relief and medication that relaxes the ureter needed while this happens , says mr ajayi\nbut if a stone is bigger , you may need to have treatment\nthe most common is extracorporeal shock - wave lithotripsy ( eswl )\nthis involves sending shock - waves of energy through the skin that break down the stone\n' this works for stones up to about 10 mm in diameter , but not for bigger ones , or for stones that are very hard , ' says mr ajayi\n' it 's also ineffective in most cases for people with obesity , as the shock - waves have further to go to reach the stone\n' for bigger or harder stones , a ureteroscopy is performed\nunder general anaesthetic , a thin scope is passed up your urethra and a laser is used to break up the stone\nfor very large stones ( those over 15 mm ) , percutaneous nephrolithotomy ( pcnl ) is used\na nephroscope - a telescope - like device - is inserted through a small incision in your back\nthe stone is broken up using a combination of high - frequency ultrasound and pneumatic energy ( a bit like a pneumatic drill digging up a road )\ndavid crossley had a ureteroscopy at the bmi priory hospital , birmingham , in september\n' i was out the day after my surgery , and although there was some discomfort around my kidneys for a few days , thankfully i 'm now stone - free\n' he knows that a person who has had a stone has a 50 per cent chance of developing them again within five years unless they make changes to their lifestyle\n' the lifestyle changes that can be made to stop stones recurring are the same as those for avoiding them in the first place : proper hydration , low - salt , staying a healthy weight and reducing animal protein , ' says mr ajayi\nthe british association of urological surgeons advises that we should be aiming for no more than four of the following protein portions a day , two of which should be dairy to ensure you have enough calcium : 50 - 75 g of red meat , chicken or fish ; two eggs ; Â½ pint of milk ; 50g cheese ; a small pot of yogurt\nmr ajayi also recommends drinking water with lemon juice in it daily , as the citrate ( a form of acetic acid ) in lemons is a natural stone inhibitor that can prevent calcium from binding with other substances , such as oxalates , that lead to stones\ntoday , david crossley ensures that he gets enough fluid\n' i did n't know that being too busy to drink enough could lead to kidney stones , ' he says\n' i now drink water religiously !

you may also have heard about pre and probiotics\nit âs all based on the principle that our bodies are absolutely filled with bacteria , most of which are good ; in fact we would nât be able to survive without them\nfermented foods , including pickled cabbage , act as a probiotic - encouraging the growth of ' good ' bacteria so it seems right that we should treat them right by adding pre-biotics to our diet to encourage growth of the good bacteria and maybe try a daily probiotic which contain cultures of good bacteria to add to our gut population\nfermented foods such as yoghurt , cheese and asian pickled ingredients such as kimchi ( pickled cabbage ) are an example of probiotics\nare they good for me ? yes\nthere âs more and more evidence to suggest that having a healthy population of bacteria is important for eveything from a smooth digestion process to preventing side - effects of antibiotic medication\ntaking a daily probiotic is also fairly easy in the form of a probiotic yoghurt or yoghurt drink\nsprouted foods it 's now being claimed that the intake of sprouted wholegrains can have health benefits over and above those delivered with your plain old standard wholegrains such as rice , wheat and oats\nthe theory goes that we harvest our grains prematurely , not allowing them to sprout , like an onion would if left\nbone broth has a much lower salt content than shop bought soups , helping lower blood pressure when sprouted , we are able to digest the grains more readily and absorb more nutrients such as protein , b vitamins and minerals such as iron and calcium\nthere âs lots of evidence emerging of their impact on health such as decreasing blood pressure and fighting diabetes\nshould i invest at the supermarket ? maybe\nthey may provide you with lots of vitamins and minerals which you would nât naturally yield from the standard grain , but they âre a fairly expensive product\nyou can also find these vitamins and minerals from a varied diet containing plenty of fruit , veg , calcium - rich dairy products ( or alternatives ) , wholegrains and meat , fish or alternatives\nbone broth this has recently made famous by the health - conscious chefs the hemsley sisters\nin fact , it âs been around for centuries and has always been used as stock , as a base in soups and saucy dishes\nit âs also well - known for its health benefits , with the bone - boiling process leaching out amino acids , collagen - for skin and bone health - and other important vitamins and minerals\nadding onions or leeks , carrots and celery , and any other old veg that you have lying around , will add antioxidants along with flavour\nshall i join the club ? yes your mother , grandmother and great - grandmothers have probably been using this recipe for hundreds of years\ntraditionally it is used to add flavour to dishes but it âs also a great way to add nutrients without much effort\nplus it has a much lower salt content than using shop - bought stocks , so is much better for your blood pressure\n... but now a word of warning food fads are named such usually because they âre an unsustainable fashion trend\nsome can even be dangerous\nhave a think to yourself when you hear of the new craze ; are you being advised to ingest something which sounds inedible ? would i find it hard to keep the changes up long - term ? if so , they âre probably not a sensible idea\nanother point to remember is that just because they âre being sold in a health food or wholefoods shop , it does nât mean they âre â healthy â\nyou can still buy chocolate from these shops\nsorry to burst your bubble , but just because you buy it from a health food shop , it does nât magically become healthy\nwe would suggest that you do your research before rushing into anything\nto find out more visit www.vavista.com", "labels": "1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0", "summaries": "dietitian sophie claessens picks the latest ' miracle ' foods from fads\ncharcoal to ' detox ' , while freekah is new supergrain on the culinary scene\nfermented foods like pickled cabbage act like a probiotic yoghurt\nand spiralizers to create vegetable spaghetti can help boost weight loss"}
