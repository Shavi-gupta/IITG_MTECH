possibly homo habilis\nthe stone tools were discovered buried in sediment at a site called lomekwi on the coast of lake turkana the stone tools may have been made by relatives of ' lucy ' , a female australopithecus afarensis that lived 3.2 million years ago who is shown above in a reconstruction at the houston museum of natural science in texas recent discoveries have suggested that the homo genus first began around 2.8 million years ago , but the tools discovered at lake turkana are 500,000 years older than that\nas they were found close to the site where kenyanthropus platyops was discovered - which some say was actually a species of australopithecine - it suggests they made the tools\nprofessor harmand , whose team are preparing a paper on the discovery for publication in the journal nature , told the paleoanthropology society that the lomekwi 3 tools had been created by ' knappers with a developing understanding of the fracture properties of stone '\nshe said they were made using simple hammer techniques and combined battering the stones to break of flakes and a technique called core reduction\nshe said : ' the lomekwi 3 tools mark a new beginning to the known archaeological record\n' according to alison brooks , an anthropologist at george washington university in washington dc , the finds are ' very exciting\nshe told the journal science : ' they could not have been created by natural forces\n' that the she added that technology shown in the tools may have actually played a major role in the emergence of our genus - homo\ndr simon underdown , an anthropologist at oxford brookes university , described the research as ' exciting '\nhe said : ' it âs important to remember that the first stone tools we can recognise as manufactured objects are very unlikely to have been the first tools used\n' organic material like wood or bone rarely preserves in the archaeological record and the first stone tools would have looked very like lumps of broken rock ( lacking the detailed patterns we see with later stone tools )\n' this new research is incredibly exciting as it pushed back the date for tool making by almost a million years which in turn means tools were being used even earlier than that\n' this fossilised jawbone with teeth still in place is thought to belong to the earliest member of the homo genus 2.8 million years ago but this is still 500,000 years short of the time when stone tools were being used", "labels": "1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1", "summaries": "archaeologists have found 20 stones shaped by early humans using ' simple techniques ' close to the west shore of lake turkana in kenya\nthe tools are thought to be 500,000 years older than the first homo species\nthey are also 700,000 years older than other stone tools found previously\nscientists say it could reshape ideas about how our own species evolved"}

{"doc": "the oldest human footprints left behind on a muddy lakeside 1.5 million years ago appear to have been made by prehistoric hunting parties\nresearchers examining the site where a series of tracks left by a barefooted early human in ileret , northwest kenya , have now found a total of 99 prints\nthey now believe that they belong to groups who all passed over the soft mud at the same time - perhaps even stalking some of the other animals whose prints are also preserved in the mud\nthe distinct tracks found at ileret in kenya ( like the one above ) are the oldest human footprints in the world it provides some of the strongest evidence yet that the human ancestors that left the prints - homo erectus - were sophisticated hunters\nwhile their ancestors before them may have eaten meat they scavenged or from small prey they were able to catch , hunting parties suggests homo erectus went after larger prey\nearly human ancestors may have evolved to throw spears allowing them to hunt around two million years ago , a new study has suggested\nresearch by dr roach has shown that the that the skeletons of homo erectus had shoulders and collar bones that would have allowed them to hurl sticks accurately and powerfully\nthis would have enabled homo erectus to become a proficient hunter , able to throw weapons like spears and rocks at potential prey\ndr roach , a palaeoanthropologist at the american museum of natural history in new york who led the study , said the prints appeared to have been made by adult males\nhe said that the tracks represent groups hunting for antelope or wildebeest\nspeaking to nature , dr roach said : ' what we can say is that we have a number of individuals , probably males , that are moving across a lake shore in a way that is consistent with how carnivores move\nthe researchers , who presented their findings at the annual meeting of the paleoanthropology society in san francisco , hope to test their conclusions by studying the movement patterns of modern day subsistence hunters in africa\nthe tracks in ileret were first revealed in 2009 after researchers at bournemouth university and rutgers â koobi fora field school in kenya , announced they had discovered a collection of 22 human prints\nthis deep print appears to have been left by a male homo erectus that may have been part of a hunting party analysis of the print tracks ( above ) showed they had been made by a early human that walked much like we do the prints were preserved in sediment that had once been the shoreline of an ancient lake\nalongside the human prints were those of birds including storks , pelicans as well as crocodiles , antelope , hippos , bovids and other predators\nprofessor matthew bennett , who was part of the team that originally studied the footprints , is shown above crouching in front of the ancient human tracks analysis of the footprints by professor matthew bennett at bournemouth university revealed the human prints had been made by a species with a similar bipedal stance and gait to modern humans , with a pronounced arch and short toes\nhe concluded that the prints had probably been left by homo erectus - an extinct species of early human that disappeared around 200,000 years ago\nthey were among the longest surviving of all the human species - surviving for around 1.5 million years\nthere is some evidence that they may have also been able to control fire and cooked food\nfootprints this old are extremely rare as they tend to erode away in a few thousand years , but are also valuable as they can give clues about behaviour\ndr roach and his colleagues decided to study the prints in more detail in order to get a snapshot of the life led by homo erectus\nover a four year excavation period a total of 483 prints in the ileret sediment have now been uncovered - 99 of which were human\nunlike the grass - eating antelope and other hooved tracks preserved in the stone - whose tracks led from grasslands to the shore - the human prints all walked in one direction along the shoreline\nthis matched the behaviour of other hunting animals whose prints were also preserved\nprevious work by dr roach has also shown that homo erectus had developed the physic needed to be a deadly hunter\nhomo erectus , shown in the reconstruction above , may have hunted large prey in groups or hunting parties fossilised skeletons how their shoulders and collar bones would have allowed them to throw sticks or spears both accurately and powerfully\ndr roach said : ' there âs starting to be a consensus that around 2 million years ago we see more carnivory that has to do with hunting\n' curtis marean , a palaeoanthropologist at arizona state university in tempe , said it was hard to tell from the prints exactly what had made them\nhe told nature : ' it could be a group hunt , but it could also be lake shore foraging\n' tucking into meat for dinner helped early humans spread more quickly across the world and had a profound effect on human evolution , scientists say\nthe high - quality diet allowed mothers to wean babies earlier and have more children , meaning that human communities grew faster , according to researchers from lund university in sweden\nthe research compared 67 species of mammals , including humans , apes , mice and killer whales , and found a clear correlation between eating meat and earlier weaning\nthey found young of all species stop suckling when their brains have developed to a particular stage , but that carnivores reached this point more quickly than herbivores or omnivores\neating meat enabled the breast - feeding periods and thereby the time between births to be shortened , according tot he researchers\namong natural fertility societies , the average duration of breast - feeding is 2 years and 4 months\nthis is not much in relation to the maximum lifespan of our species , around 120 years\nit is even less if compared to our closest relatives : female chimpanzees suckle their young for 4 to 5 years , whereas the maximum lifespan for chimpanzees is only 60 years .", "labels": "1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0", "summaries": "researchers at the american museum of natural history in new york have found 99 footprints that appear to have been left by male homo erectus\nthe footprints -

' the minibar is the most fallible system in the hotel , ' jacob tomsky tells mailonline travel\n' human error , over-stocking , failure to re-stock , errant charges from weighted items being shifted but not consumed , all of these lead the front desk to spend hours a day slicing off incorrect charges\n' he also notes that the ' items are purchased in bulk and sold at an absurd mark - up\n' ' hotels are much more concerned with your overall experience and securing further room nights - the main revenue stream - than whether or not you ate a candy bar\n' holovacs , a front office supervisor at a major hotel chain and an adjunct hospitality instructor , adds : ' if an item has not sold , it 's just like any other retail setting - the item is pulled when it reaches its expiration date\n' because certain rooms have varying levels of cleaning difficulty , they are usually awarded ' points ' how long does it take to clean a hotel room ? is there anything that typically does not get cleaned ? the length of cleaning time generally depends on the room\nbecause rooms have varying levels of difficulty , they are usually awarded ' points ' and housekeepers must clean a certain total of points in one day\nthis may translate to a few larger suites or simply multiple standard rooms\n' i 'd guess the average time is between 30 minutes to an hour to flip the room , ' jacob tomsky estimates\n' a great deal of that time discrepancy depends on how the guest has left the room\n' once a year , large sections of rooms , or even entire floors are pulled out of service for maintenance and deep cleaning\n' this is includes sending the draperies out for cleaning and shampooing the carpets , ' holovacs explains\nhowever , minibar glasses are often cleaned less thoroughly , usually soaked in shampoo or furniture polish when it comes to the items that are cleaned less frequently or less thoroughly ? minibar glasses and the remote control\n' housekeepers are usually responsible for cleaning the glasses , yet are not provided with dish soap , ' he explains\n' so they either soak them in the sink with shampoo or , in a pinch , use furniture polish , as it leaves a ' clean - looking ' shine\n' and have you ever tried to clean your own remote ? ' the rubbery buttons make it near impossible and dousing it with a cleaning agent could damage the circuitry , ' jacob tomsky adds\nhow much money hotels spend on toiletries generally depends on the scale of the property and its occupancy how much do hotels generally spend on toiletries per year ? this one has everything to do with the scale of the property and its occupancy\naccording to a recent forbes article , the marriott hotel chain will spend approximately $ 20 million annually on their thann products , a natural skincare line that 's stocked in their americas and asia pacific hotels\n' usually the ordering is done by a housekeeping manager who takes into account the current supply and the average monthly uses from years past , ' jacob tomsky reveals\n' people use more toiletries in the winter , have longer showers , and go through more toilet paper\n' it 's a rather intriguing ordering process based on a large amount of collected data\n' and , ultimately , you do n't want to be the one who fails to order enough toilet paper for the entire hotel\n' though there 's a belief that hotel staffer furnish their home with amenities , jacob tomsky says it 's not often the case and do staff ever get to take them home ? ' there 's a long history of hotel staffers semi-furnishing their own home with hotel amenities , ' jacob tomsky admits\n' every party i threw from 2001 to 2004 was catered with hotel pillow chocolates\n' for the most part , items are either so pre-used that to take them would be distasteful , or so expensive that to steal them would n't be worth the loss of one 's job\n' but i do have shoe polish that i 've never paid for and hotel - branded slippers to keep me comfy in the wintertime\n' one charity has come up with a novel way to deal with leftover hotel soaps - churning them together to provide soap to those in developing countries\nclean the world , receives partially - used and discarded soap from hotels , recycles it into millions of new bars , and then works with partner global soap to strategically distribute the new soap to people who lack access to it around the world\npeople dying in their hotel room is not quite as rare of an occurrence as guests may think , jacob tomsky admits what happens if someone dies in a hotel room ? while a bit morbid to talk about , jacob tomsky admits that such an occurrence is not quite as rare as guests may think\n' it 's not something a hotel wishes to publicise , naturally , ' he explains\n' so , they are removed as discreetly as possible\n' this may involve flashing lights and paramedics , depending on the severity of the situation , but can also happen via employee elevators and back exits\n' afterwards , the room is sanitised , cleaned , ' flipped ' and sold - and that can happen a lot faster than you 'd think\nand , of course , all hotel staffers are forbidden from revealing any details - including cause of death and room numbers - to anyone\n' death is a part of hotel life , ' jacob tomsky adds\n' in fact , suicides often prefer hotels , relieving loved ones of the cleaning duties or seeing the deceased in a disturbing way\n' guests should take comfort in knowing that their in - room safes are actually very secure do staff actually have access to the in - room safes ? no , they do not\nthe safes truly are , you know , safe\n' i always recommend using the safe to every traveller , ' jacob tomsky says\n' the only person who can open the safe , should you forget your password , is a manager from the security department , using a tool that only they are trained and authorised to use\n' what really happens to that half - used roll of loo paper in hotel room bathrooms ? well , it depends ... and finally , what happens to the half - used loo roll in hotel room bathrooms ? there 's a bit of dispute over this one , and again , a lot of times it depends on the hotel itself\nin the spirit of being environmentally - minded , most chains will simply refold the paper and leave the half - used roll in the bathroom , with another full roll behind it , should the guest run out\nif there 's not enough left to warrant leaving it , a quora thread user , who works for the beechmont hotels corporation , believes that the nearly - used up roll most likely winds up on housekeeping carts for when a room attendant needs a tissue for other cleaning tasks or in employee bathrooms .", "labels": "1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0", "summaries": "yes , it is possible to steal a robe from your hotel without being charged\nmany properties often have extra complimentary amenities up for grabs\nbut beware of minibar glasses - they 're often cleaned with furniture polish\nauthor jacob tomsky answers every question you have about hotel stays"}
