looking creature had small stiff feathers on its body and long finger - like bones extending from each wrist that were covered in a membrane like a bat âs wing\nthe dinosaur may have been able to glide and even flap scientists believe the dinosaur , which they have named yi qi , meaning â strange wing â , may have glided or even flown through the air\nthe discovery has provided new insight into how vertebrates first began to take to the air\na new lineage of dinosaur that grazed on plants , despite being closely related to notorious carnivore t-rex , has been discovered in chile\npalaeontologists are referring to chilesaurus diegosuarezi as a ' platypus ' dinosaur because of its bizarre combination of characteristics , including its small skull and feet\nthese features are more like those seen on long - neck dinosaurs\nthe animal is proving to be an evolutionary jigsaw puzzle because it belongs to the theropod group of dinosaurs - which were predominantly carnivorous and included the famous meat eaters velociraptor , carnotaurus and t-rex , from which birds today evolved - but was a vegetarian\nthe presence of herbivorous theropods was up until now only known in close relatives of birds , but chilesaurus diegosuarezi shows a meat - free diet was acquired much earlier than first thought\nthe dinosaur from the late jurassic period , around 145 million years ago , is named after the country where it was discovered , and diego suã¡rez , who discovered the bones\npalaeontologists are referring to chilesaurus diegosuarezi ( illustrated ) as a ' platypus ' dinosaur because of its bizarre combination of features researchers say the dinosaur , which would have weighted just 13 ounces ( 380g ) and was 33cm ( 12 inches ) long with a wings that spanned 60cm ( 23 inches ) , may have been an early evolutionary experiment with flight\nyi belongs the group of carnivorous dinosaurs known as the therapods - which includes t-rex and velociraptor\nthese dinosaurs are thought to have been the ancestors of modern birds\nbut unlike modern birds , yi qi was found to have a strange extra bone extending backwards from its wrist , rather like an entirely separate group of animals that learned to fly - the bats\nprofessor xu , one of the world âs leading prolific palaeontologists at the chinese academy of sciences in beijing and who led the work , said : ' this is really something for me\nit is the most unexpected discovery i ever made\n' birds are descended from dinosaurs , but how exactly the transition occurred is not really clear\nthis new discovery is a new species of these bird like dinosaurs\n' this dinosaur is totally different\nit has totally different wings from all other birds and their close relatives\n' close to the origin of birds there are many lineages trying to get into the air but there was only one group that succeeded\n' i would have said this example shows how much experimentation close to this transition\n' the discovery comes in the same week as researchers announced the discovery of a bizarre vegetarian relative of the t-rex\nthe yi qi fossil was discovered by a local farmer in mutoudeng , in qinglong county , hebei province in china\nthe fossil has preserved stiff filamentous features on the forelimb and hindlimb , along with patches of the membrane that once stretched across its wings\nhowever , it was the strange wrists and long rod - like bones that extended from them that baffled the attention of the palaeontologists\nthere are three main groups of flying vertebrates - the birds , which evolved from dinosaurs , pterosaurs that were flying reptiles that existed alongside the dinosarus , and the bats , which are mammals that evolved after the extinction of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago\nmost winged avian dinosaurs to be discovered so far all have wing structures that are similar to those of modern birds\nhowever , yi qi , which is pronounced ' ee chee ' , appears to be a weird hybrid between a dinosaur and a bat\nthis suggests that at the time several different types of winged dinosaurs evolved wings in an attempt to fly\nthe fossil of yi qi ( above ) was so well preserved that bristle - like feathers and the remains of its membrane wings could be seen around the bones\nthe strange long bone extending from the wrist was highly unusual this close up of the skull of yi qi , which weighed just 13 ounces ( 380g ) , show oval like feathers near the head analysis by professor xu and his colleagues , which is published in the journal nature , suggest that it is likely the dinosaur glided , perhaps like modern flying squirrels\nthe dinosaur lacked the strong muscle attachments to the forelimb bones and its bone structure would have interfered with the flapping and rotating movements needed during powered flight\ninstead it may have launched itself from elevated perches and glided to the ground\nif it did flap its wings it would probably have only been able to fly over short distances\nbut professor xu said : ' we thought giving this animal a name meaning \" strange wing \" was appropriate , because no other bird or dinosaur has a wing of the same kind ' we do nât know if yi qi was flapping , or gliding , or both , but it definitely evolved a wing that is unique in the context of the transition from dinosaurs to birds\n' it is likely that the conclusions will be controversial with other evolutionary biologists , but it could prove hugely valuable in unravelling how birds evolved from their dinosaur ancestors\nprofessor zheng xiaoting , from linyi university in shandong who also took part in the study , said : ' yi qi lived in the jurassic , so it was a pioneer in the evolution of flight on the line to birds\n' it reminds us that the early history of flight was full of innovations , not all of which survived\n' dr kevin padian , a palaeontologist at the university of california berkeley , warned that the animal may not have been able to fly at all\nthe fossil of yi qi was discovered by a farmer working his fields in mutoudeng in qinglong county in china the diagrams above show how the wing of yi ( a ) compares to other winged tetrapods ( b and c ) and the wing of a bat ( d ) , the wing of a pigeon ( e ) , the wing of a pterosaur ( f ) and the wing of a japanese flying squirrel ( g ) he said : â as for gliding , if yi âs styliform element helped to support a membranous aerofoil , it can be used to reconstruct the planform of the wing , as xu and colleagues have done\nâ but in a gliding animal , the centre of lift of the aerofoil should be fairly congruent with the centre of gravity of the body â if the bulk of the animal âs weight falls too far behind the centre of lift , the back end will sag and the animal will stall\nâ that is clearly the case in the authors â reconstruction of yi qi , but an aerofoil that was swept back more , if anatomically possible , might have mitigated this problem\nâ still , we are left in a quandary : an animal with a strange structure that looks as if it could have been used in flight , borne by an animal that otherwise shows no such tendencies\nâ and so far , there is no other plausible explanation for the function of this structure", "labels": "1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0", "summaries": "yi qi is thought to have lived 160 million years ago during the late jurassic\nthe dinosaur has an unusual bone sticking out of its wrist and had a membrane that covered it to form a wing much like that of a modern bat\nscientists say it is unlike any other dinosaur , which evolved into birds , and may have glided or even been able to fly by flapping over short distances\nthe fossil was discovered by a farmer in qinglong county in north china"}

in the sbs one series horizon professor alice roberts and dr mosley examine the links between gender and the brain the sbs one series horizon asked professor alice roberts and me to investigate\nwe started from very different positions\nalice thinks apparent brain differences between the sexes have been exaggerated by how our culture treats boys and girls\nin the programme she carries out fascinating tests to prove her point , such as dressing up little boys as girls and vice versa and watching how people treat them\nalmost immediately , the girls start rough - housing and playing with trucks , while the boys are treated far more gently by the adults around them\nshe argues that parents â unconscious actions â such as being gentler with girls and letting boys behave more roughly â often mould children into men and women who embody gender stereotypes\nwhile i agree that lots of wild generalisations about men and women are bandied around , i also think there may be something in claims that our fundamental biology influences how we behave\nprofessor simon baron-cohen , an expert on the brain who i visited at cambridge university , has done a lot of pioneering work on this\nhe believes , broadly , that people of whatever gender fall somewhere along a â systemiser â to â empathiser â spectrum\nsystemisters : according to popular mythology , men tend to be more obsessed by things such as cars and obscure facts , like these young train spotters pictured at chislehurst and sidcup station systemisters are people who enjoy breaking down and analysing systems\nthey are more likely to become train spotters or computer scientists\nthey are what he has called â male brained â â as these qualities occur most frequently , but far from exclusively , in men\nempathisers , on the other hand , are more typically â female â brained as they are more typically women\nalthough there are exceptions , most men â when tested â come out as more â systemising â than â empathising â , while for women it is the other way round\nwhile professor simon baron-cohen accepts social pressures are important in influencing choices and behaviour , his studies suggest the hormones babies are exposed to in the womb can also shape the brain\nhigher levels of testosterone in utero , for example â as measured in long - term studies that took samples from pregnant women then followed their children from birth â are associated with offspring who are less empathetic but better at some mental skills later in life\nin other words , more testosterone during pregnancy produces babies with a more male brain ( we âre not yet sure why some mothers produce more testosterone )\ndr mosley will examine if habits , characteristics and preferences are a result of ' nature or nurture ' empathisers , on the other hand , are more typically â female â brained as they are more typically women an indirect way of assessing how much testosterone you were exposed to is by looking at your fingers\na number of studies have shown that the greater the difference between the length of the ring finger and the index finger , the more â male â your brain is likely to be\nmine is slightly more â male â than average but much less so than , say , a professional footballer , who is typically male brained with great spatial awareness skills\nas you can imagine , this is a controversial area of science\nprofessor simon baron-cohen does these studies because he is interested in autism , which he describes as an extreme version of the male brain â more interested in systems and often struggling with empathy\nwhen he started his research there was a lot of criticism , based partly on the fear studies like his will be used to support unhelpful stereotypes â suggesting men ca nât excel in female areas and vice versa\nignoring gender differences , however , comes with its own dangers\ntake the problem of pain\na while ago , when i was making a programme called pleasure and pain , we did a survey where we asked people which of the sexes they thought was better at tolerating pain â 81 per cent of women said â women â , while a mere 11 per cent thought men were the tougher breed\na number of studies have shown that the greater the difference between the length of the ring finger and the index finger , the more â male â your brain is likely to be although men were more inclined to give themselves the benefit of the doubt , the majority , 54 per cent , still agreed â women â were more stoical\nbut is this right ? one way to find out is to get male and female volunteers to take part in a cold water immersion test\nthis is a standard pain test widely used because it causes acute pain without doing any long - term damage ( as long as you do nât do it for more than 15 minutes )\nin this test , you put your hand in a bucket of ice - cold water and see how long you can keep it there before the pain becomes intolerable\ni âve done it a couple of times and oddly enough after the initial shock it does nât actually feel cold ; below about 3 degrees celsius your pain receptors overwhelm your temperature receptors so you are no longer able to tell if the water is hot or freezing\nall you know is that it is incredibly painful\nwhen this test is done in a laboratory setting , men almost always outlast women\nthis may be pure machismo , but professor jeff of mcgill university , montreal , thinks there is more to it\nas he puts it : â there are all kinds of reasons to believe there are different neural systems in the brain of males and females\nâ that is , our brains process pain differently because our brains are different : our varying ability to withstand pain is proof\nhe thinks it is unfortunate that much basic pain research has , until recently , been done in male animals\nalthough men were more inclined to give themselves the benefit of the doubt , the majority , 54 per cent , still agreed â women â were more stoical males do nât menstruate or go on heat , which makes them simpler and cheaper to study\nbut it also means we have been developing and testing drugs on males , assuming that they will work just as well on females , which may not be the case\nwe âve come to realise , for example , paracetamol works better on men , while some opioids work better on women\nwe do nât , however , know why\nthat situation is now changing as researchers involve more females and start actively looking for differences\nindeed , jeff imagines a future where pharmaceutical companies produce pain - killing drugs that are specific to one gender\nso perhaps we âll have pink painkillers for women , and blue ones for boys , each honed to work on the specific male or female brain\nâ if that happens , â says jeff , â that âll be a first in medicine\nâ it may also mean far more effective medication for all of us\nhead injury , a leading cause of death and disability in young people , is another area where studying gender differences could bring significant benefits\nis your brain male or female ?

tipped tail to woo potential mates ( illustrated ) , much like modern peacocks the team theorised that like birds , small feathered dinosaurs such as oviraptors used long feathers on their tails to attract mates , rather than for flying\nâ my analysis of the tail skeletons supported this theory , because the skeletons showed adaptations for both high tail flexibility and enlarged tail musculature - both traits that would have helped an oviraptor to flaunt its tail fan in a mating dance , â mr persons said\nafter studying the fossils carefully , his team found signs of sexual dimorphism in the length and shape of blade - like bones called chevrons , which point downwards from the vertebrae near the base of the tail\na number of chevrons in one of the fossils were longer and had broader tips than those in the other specimen , indicating the creature is male , the experts said\nthey suggested that males had larger chevrons to anchor the muscles that controlled their flexible , feather - tipped tails\nthe researchers suspect that male oviraptorosaurs shook their tail feathers in intricate displays to woo potential mates , akin the behaviour of modern - day peacocks\nthey suspect females had shorter chevrons to make laying eggs easier\nscientists have recently shown that peacocks shake their tails to make a noise that is too low for us to hear\ntheir mating ritual may bear some resemblance to that of small feathered dinosaurs scientists have shown that peacocks ( stock image ) shake their tails to make a noise that is too low for us to hear scientists have shown that peacocks shake their tails to make a noise that is too low for us to hear\nmale birds may make the infrared rumble to scare off an approaching rival or to attract a mate\nresearchers at the university of manitoba in winnipeg , canada , have shown that the birds make infrasound noises - below 20 hertz - using their tails and that other peacocks respond to them\nhumans hear a rustling sound when this happens , but the experts found that the birds hear a loud sound of between 70 and 108 decibels , according to the study published in the journal animal behaviour\nmale and female peacocks became more alert and moved around when the low noises were played back to them by researchers , with males shrieking out in response\nexperts are unsure how the birds detect infrasound , but know that some can feel vibration through their legs\ngraduate student freeman observed that male peacocks were most likely to make the low sounds when they showed off their train feathers , producing two displays which she called the â shiver train â and the â pulse train â\nthe shiver train is produced by vibration of the train feathers from the centre feathers to the outside of the array and is used by males when females are far away\nthe pulse train is produced by a vibration emanating from the base of all the train feathers and it is used when the female is nearby\npeacocks â tails are a sign of strength and good genes , so a strong noise may reinforce a message of virility , ms freeman said\nthis could be especially useful as the birds live in scrubby woodland , where high noises can only travel over short distances and birds sometimes ca nât see each other\nâ we think that possibly these signals could signal to females and males who are out of sight behind a bush or over the hill , â she added\nthe two raptors were discovered in the gobi desert of mongolia\nboth died and were buried next to each other when a large sand dune collapsed on top of them , creating the interesting fossil\nwhen they were first unearthed , the two oviraptors were given the nicknames romeo because they seemed reminiscent of shakespeare 's famously doomed lovers\nâ we discovered that , although both oviraptors were roughly the same size , the same age and otherwise identical in all anatomical regards , â romeo â had larger and specially shaped tail bones , â mr persons said\nâ this indicates that it had a greater capacity for courtship displays and was likely a male\nâ by comparison , the second specimen , juliet , had shorter and simpler tail bones , suggesting a lesser capacity for peacocking , and has been interpreted as a female\naccording to persons , the two may very well have been a mated pair , making for a romantic story , as the dinosaur couple was preserved side by side for more than 75 million years\nwhile the theory is compelling , thomas holtz , a vertebrate paleontologist at the college park in college park told nature that it âs not yet completely convincing , because only one pair of oviraptor specimens have been studied\ntherefore , there is a possibility that the difference in chevron shape was a variation , rather than a sign of sexual dismorphism .", "labels": "1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0", "summaries": "' egg thief lizards ' preserved in rock for 75 million years were studied\nuniversity of alberta experts said differences in size and shape of tail bones enable male and female small feathered dinosaurs to be sexed\nmales have long ' chevron ' bones so they can wiggle their feathered tails seductively to woo mates , while females have shorter bones in their tails"}

block as the heavier analogs of scandium and yttrium , whereas la and ac should be considered as the first members of the f - block with irregular configurations\n' lr , represented by the diagram left , was discovered by nuclear scientist lawrence ( right ) lr was first generated by lawrence by bombarding californium atoms with boron atoms to create the new superheavy element\nhowever , scientists have only ever been able to produce minuscule amounts of the substance and it has a half life of 27 seconds\nthe new study , which is published in the journal nature , used the same approach as lawrence to create the element that bears his name but captured it in a helium and cadmium iodide gas\nthis was passed through a heated tantalum surface giving the short - lived lawrencium enough energy to shed its outer electron - the ionisation potential\nthe researchers found this matched a recent prediction of 4.96ev - giving it the lowest ionisation potential of all elements in the f - block\nthis representation of the periodic table shows the ionisation potential of elements following the new results however , in a statement , the japan atomic energy agency said it did not feel it affected the structure of the periodic table\nthey said : ' since the introduction of the ' actinide concept ' as the most dramatic modern revision of the periodic table by glenn seaborg in the 1940s , the element with atomic number 103 , lawrencium ( lr ) , played a crucial role as the last element in the actinide series\n' we show that removing the outermost electron requires least energy in lr among all actinides , as was expected\nt ' this validates the position of lr as the last actinide element and confirms the architecture of the periodic table\n' however , dr eric scerri , a chemist and historian at the university of california los angeles , said the results supported the push to move lawrencium into the min part of the table\nhe said : ' if the periodic table is presented in the more correct 32 - column or long - format , and if one maintains the order of increasing atomic numbers throughout the table , one is inevitably led to the conclusion that lu and lr belong to group 3 and that la and ac should be placed at the start of the f - block elements\n' despite the debate the result is likely to now generate , professor andreas tã¼rler , a chemist at the albert einstein centre for fundamental physics at the university of bern , switzerland , described the experiment as ' spectacular '\nthe researchers were able to study lawrencium for the first time using an ionizer cavity ( left ) which revealed that the element has one of the lowest ionisation potentials of any of the atoms in the f - block ( right )", "labels": "1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1", "summaries": "the japan atomic energy agency has studied lawrencium for the first time\nthe element is extremely difficult to make and has a half life of 27 seconds\nthey found it is different from other rare radioactive elements in the f -
