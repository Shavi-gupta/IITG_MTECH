the body 's built - in shock absorber - and increasing the risk of osteoarthritis\nsome women need invasive knee replacement surgery\nin the study carried out by stanford university 's biomotion team , the knees of healthy women were scanned as they walked at normal pace in flat shoes , 1Â½ in heels and 3Â½ in heels\nthey found that in high heels , women 's knees are held in such an awkward , bent position that their joints looked and performed like aged or damaged joints - increasing the risk of osteoarthritis\nphysiotherapist and osteopath tim allardyce is n't surprised : patients with postural problems caused or exacerbated by heels are common at his croydon clinic\n' because of the odd angle at which the feet are held in high - heeled shoes , it increases the downward pressure on the knees by 25 per cent , placing significant stress on the kneecaps , even when you 're standing still , ' he says\nat 5ft 3in , angela had always loved the extra height afforded by her favourite heels\n' i wore vertiginous stilettos and towering platforms every day of my teens and 20s , ' she says\n' and after that , a 3 in heel or more , whenever i wanted to look smart\n' even the first twinge of arthritis , which began in her right knee in her early 30s , could n't persuade her to kick her heel habit - instead , she gritted her teeth and controlled the pain with anti- inflammatories , until it suddenly worsened four years ago\nshe had almost no cartilage left in her knee and needed to have a titanium knee replacement ' i was struggling to get out of bed or in and out of the car , ' she says\n' i sometimes had to use crutches to get about and would have to lean heavily on a trolley to get around the supermarket\n' all my lovely high - heeled shoes had to be banished and i started living in trainers\n' my husband rob and my friends were all very sweet , telling me i looked great in my frumpy , flat shoes and encouraging me to get my knee sorted out - but i felt really down about it\n' if i walked any distance or tried to play badminton , my knee would swell horribly and i 'd have to apply ice packs to control the pain\n' tests showed that i had almost no cartilage left in my knee and it became obvious that i needed to have a titanium knee replacement , which involved major surgery and a lengthy recovery period\n' luckily , angela 's knee surgery at the royal bolton hospital in 2011 was a success\nafter following the advice of her doctor and physiotherapist to swear off heels altogether , to avoid damaging her new , artificial knee , she is fitter than ever\nshe has lost 1Â½ st , is playing badminton several times a week and goes to the gym regularly\n' i miss my heels and envy friends who can still wear them , ' she says\nthe average woman spends Â£ 136.52 on five new pairs of shoes a year the knee op was n't her only surgery\n' i had to have a bunion surgically removed from my left foot last year , too , which was caused - or certainly worsened - by years of wearing tight , pointy stilettos\n' i probably would have paid more attention to the fit of my shoes , rather than how fashionable they looked , if i 'd known they would force me to go under the knife twice\n' vanity is the obvious reason why angela is far from the only woman willing to suffer for fashion - there 's no question that legs look longer and more elegant in beautiful heels\nin a recent survey of 1,200 women , 93 per cent said they felt sexier and more feminine when they wore heels , 88 per cent said they considered themselves more stylish and 77 per cent said their heels made them feel slimmer\nwith statistics like those , it 's no surprise that many women seem to take a dangerously ' no pain , no gain ' approach to their footwear , however dire the warnings\nretired teacher susan , 61 , has also suffered life - changing knee problems from wearing heels since she was a teenager\n' my husband and i go on a lot of cruises , and recently took up ballroom dancing , which call for lots of dressing up and wearing high - heels for hours on end , ' she says\nbut unbearable knee pain that began in 2010 , when she was 55 , threatened to curtail her leisure activities altogether\nsusan has also suffered life - changing knee problems from wearing heels ' at first , i just put the pain down to ageing and tried to soldier on , but as time went on , over-the - counter painkillers stopped working and the niggling , arthritic pains were keeping me awake at night , ' she says\n' six months after they started , i went to see my doctor and was given steroid injections in my knee\nthey really helped in the short term , but i still found i could n't wear heels when we went out or on holiday - it was just too painful\n' i was still teaching young children at the time , but i struggled to kneel down beside them in the classroom\ni could n't drive and as i stopped being so active , i started to pile on weight and suddenly felt old , despondent and frumpy\n' susan had to undergo arthroscopies - keyhole surgery to remove damaged cartilage - on both knees before a right knee replacement by orthopaedic surgeon shivanand geeranavar at bmi edgbaston hospital improved things\n' within six weeks of having my knee replaced i was driving again and went on holiday to italy\n' within nine weeks , i could ride my bike and go back to ballroom dancing\ni still wear heels occasionally - mainly when i 'm dancing - but the heels are lower than they used to be\n' of course , arthritis and bunions are not the only problems that can be caused by high heels - squeezing feet into too - tight points can lead to misshapen hammer toes , and regular wearers of 3 in heels may suffer from tendonitis , where the achilles tendon shrinks and tightens painfully\ntim allardyce says wearing high heels regularly can also be at the root of a raft of excruciatingly painful back , hip and even neck problems\n' standing and walking on the balls of your feet throws the skeleton out of its usual , healthy alignment , which means muscles and joints throughout the body have to compensate to maintain its centre of gravity and keep the body upright , ' he says\ndespite being otherwise fit and healthy , former bbc television sports presenter sally , 60 , blames her fondness for heels for the excruciatingly painful lower back problems that plagued her 40s and 50s\nat times , the pain was so bad she was unable to drive and was forced to use a stick\n' high heels have always been considered part of a female tv presenter 's uniform , ' she says\n' not that i complained - high shoes have always be my preferred choice of footwear when i 've got to look smart\nthe shame is that i ca n't really wear them any more\n' though her back problems had been triggered by squash and tennis injuries in her 30s , sally was advised by an orthopaedic consultant and osteopath that her penchant for heels was exacerbating her problems\n' i was told to stick to flats or shoes with a very low heel and to spend as much time barefoot as possible to help correct my posture , which had been thrown out of alignment by wearing heels day in and day out , ' she says\nstanding and walking on the balls of your feet throws the skeleton out of its usual , healthy alignment ' i was also given exercises to follow to strengthen my abdominals and back muscles , and help correct the poor postural habits i had developed , which were putting strain on my lower back\n' for the past 15 years , i 've had to stick to flat footwear and keep up the exercises to keep my back pain at bay\n' i still take heels with me to slip on for tv appearances , but the twinges in my back start if i have to stand in them for more than an hour\n' for high - heel lovers not yet suffering painful problems , podiatrist michael ratcliffe advises picking shoes carefully\n' if you are after height , wear a comfy platform or a shoe with a heavy block heel - which will give you support - rather than a flimsy stiletto with a thin sole , ' he says\nand tim allardyce says : ' take a break\nif you 're wearing a pair of heels over 2 in high , limit the time spent wearing them to two hours maximum\n' after two hours , sit down , take the heels off and walk around barefoot if possible for 30 minutes to allow time for your feet and knees to recover\n' interestingly , consultant knee surgeon marcus green , at the bmi priory hospital in birmingham , has even more hope for those who ca n't bear to part with their favourite footwear - he is not convinced the link between high heels and arthritis in the knees has been proved\n' there 's no doubt that high heels change the forces on the knee joint , but none of the long - term studies i 've seen suggest they go on to cause serious knee problems , ' he says\n' yes , there is a definite link to issues such as angela 's bunions and sally 's postural problems\n' but when it comes to knees , keeping your weight down and exercising regularly to keep the supportive muscles around the knees fit and strong are , in my opinion , by far the most important steps you can take to prevent or slow down arthritis in the knees", "labels": "1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0", "summaries": "angela kelly suffered the painful legacy of a lifetime wearing high heels\nshe had arthritis in her early 30s but would n't kick her heel habit\nfour years ago , at 63 , she had have a titanium knee replacement"}

and several subsequent ones - ' paradise ' might n't seem the obvious word to describe the amazon basin in the mid 19th century\na huge anti-government uprising had destroyed much of whatever infrastructure there had been\nriver transport , the only kind available , still relied on getting the local indians to do the paddling - or , when faced with waterfalls and rapids , the heavy lifting\nflooding could cause chunks of land , some of several acres , to come hurtling down the river , smashing everything in their way\nand of course , there was a spectacular array of biting and stinging insects - including mosquitoes , which nobody had yet linked to malaria\nnonetheless , for naturalists as driven as alfred russel wallace , henry bates and richard spruce , a paradise is exactly what the amazon was\neven after being attacked by a particularly nasty species of wasp , richard spruce wrote of his admiration for ' their beauty , ingenuity and heroic ferocity '\nthese days , the image of 19th - century british travellers is perhaps of public - school types airily bossing the natives about , possibly from a sedan chair\nwell , not in this case - because alfred russel wallace , henry bates and richard spruce were all classic examples of victorian self - improvement\nnone was from a rich family and none went to school beyond 14\nall , however , soon set about the urgent task of educating themselves\nat 15 , henry bates was working 13 hours a day , six days a week , as a hosiery apprentice\nfortunately , that did n't prevent him from learning greek , latin , french , drawing and composition at the local mechanics ' institute in leicester , or from developing a passion for natural history\nnaturalist richard spruce the young alfred russel wallace loved nothing better than to curl up with the poetry of milton or dante - until he discovered the joys of plant classification\naged 17 , richard spruce carefully listed 403 species of plants near his yorkshire home , before surrendering to the seemingly irresistible appeal of mosses and liverworts\nwhen alfred russel wallace and henry bates met in leicester in 1844 , apparently at the public library , they immediately realised they were kindred spirits\nfour years later , still in their early 20s and having found a london agent to sell any specimens they sent back , they sailed to brazil , which was already recognised as an ecological treasure - trove\nin fact , after a few months together , the pair amicably separated\n( henry bates preferred to stay in one place for months at a time , while alfred russel wallace liked to go wherever his more impulsive nose led him\n) a year later , richard spruce arrived to begin his own amazon adventures , bumping into the others only occasionally\nwhat followed was a story - or three stories - of quietly stirring heroism\nsad to say , in the port of bã©lem where they landed , the biggest difference from english that alfred russel wallace and henry bates noticed was the comparative lack of drunkenness\nonce they headed inland , though , they were in another world entirely\nthey were also among people either puzzled or amused that they had come so far just to collect some plants and animals\nin general , the indians proved remarkably hospitable , as well as astonishingly skilful boatmen\nnot all tribal traditions were to english tastes - including the one where the dead were buried in the village 's huts , dug up a month later , cooked , pounded into a powder , mixed with alcohol and drunk by the assembled company\nthe non-indian locals , meanwhile , were a distinctly mixed bunch\nin one village , henry bates was amazed to come across a man whose mud - hut contained a library of well - thumbed latin classics\nin another , alfred russel wallace was both shocked and delighted by a cheerfully dissolute priest\nas an amazon explorer himself , hemming describes the endless hardships almost matter - of - factly , which only makes it clearer how hair - raising they were\neven so , when it comes to understatement , he 's still no match for the three victorians\nafter alfred russel wallace shot part of his own hand off , he confessed to feeling ' rather miserable '\nlater , he described the ants eating him alive as ' not the most agreeable companions '\nabove all , though , these men collected : gathering specimens of every conceivable type , no matter what condition they were in\n' with bleeding feet and an empty stomach , i found the journey sufficiently toilsome , ' wrote richard spruce of one trip\n' but this did not prevent me gathering plants ' - although , on a wimpier note , when he was ' near dying of hunger ' he did collect only in the afternoons\nthen there was the equally tricky business of preserving the specimens in wet jungle conditions until they could be packaged up for the journey to london\nas hemming emphasises , it 's almost miraculous that so much of what the three collected made it back in such good condition\nhenry bates alone managed to send 14,712 species , with the number of specimens naturally far higher\nthe biggest loss , in fact , came when the boat on which alfred russel wallace was travelling home in 1852 caught fire , destroying his notebooks and the live animals he 'd brought with him\nhappily , he was rescued after only a week in an open boat 700 miles from land\na lesser man might well have been discouraged by the experience\nyet within two years , alfred russel wallace was off again , this time for eight years of collecting in asia\nthere , he also developed a theory of natural selection that charles darwin realised was virtually the same as the one he himself had been sitting on for two decades - and so quickly set about writing the origin of species\n' i could never have approached the completeness of his book , ' alfred russel wallace generously declared when it was published\nmeanwhile , back in amazonia , henry bates and richard spruce were still collecting away ... hemming tells the story of this extraordinary trio without hype , wisely content to let the facts and their own reflections speak largely for themselves\nhe does , however , add the occasional telling update : we learn that some of the tribes that helped the three men are sadly now extinct\nbut perhaps the most striking moment of all comes with a short footnote on page 106 that reminds us how much the world has changed\nhaving sailed through a series of thunderstorms , richard spruce gets separated from his companions on a jungle trek and fears he 's going to die\nbut then , deep in the lonely forest , he hears something he 's long dreamed of hearing : a musician wren , which sings like a music box\n' modern readers , ' the footnote reads , ' can hear this bird by visiting www.xeno-canto.org and searching for â musician wren â\ni guarantee that it will brighten your day .", "labels": "1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0", "summaries": "naturalists in paradise tells the tale of an early trio of british explorers\nin 1961 the young oxford graduates set off to explore the iriri river\nalfred russel wallace , henry bates and richard spruce found a paradise"}

great\n' after i took out my lenses that day i threw them away but if i 'd kept them i could have sent them off to find out what the bacteria was and how it caused my infection\n' i find it hard to
