{"doc": "it is probably the most unpleasant experiment you will read about today : what happens when your skin starts to tear\nresearchers have uncovered the reason why skin is so difficult to tear even when put under extreme pressures , by cutting samples of real skin and attempting to pull them apart\nthey found that rather than simply tearing , mammalian skin actually has sophisticated stress resistance properties that prevent holes and cuts from expanding\nthe researchers cut real skin samples and then attempted to rip them by pulling them apart ( shown above ) using x-ray beams they were able to directly observe the microscopic changes that take place in skin to help it resist tearing during their stomach churning experiments\nthey discovered that the curly fibers of collagen that make up dermis of the skin straighten and stretch in response to a tear to share the load and prevent further damage\nscientists at gillette have spent nine years studying how to get the perfect shave\ntheir work has shown why washing the skin is so vital and why you should never , ever tap your razor on the sink , and also settles the debate about whether you should go with , or against the grain here are their main findings : before the shave , hydrate the hair by washing the skin with a gentle cleanser : this softens the hair and significantly reduces the force needed to cut it\napply plenty of shave gel : this provides a protective anti-friction layer and improves razor glide for a smoother , more comfortable shave\nshave with a multi-blade razor using light strokes : gillette said the razor should do the work , not the person shaving\nchange direction : begin by shaving with the grain of the hair before switching and going against this grain\nmake sure blades are not old or dull : the lifespan of razors can vary depending on how often they are used and how hard\nas a general rule if the razor begins to drag or does n't cut as closely as before , replace the blades\nuse aftershave : this can be any product containing moisturiser to rehydrate and comfort the skin\nmany aftershaves contain alcohol that acts as an astringent to sterilise the skin and provide a barrier against infection\nthe findings help to explain why the thin layer of cells that cover our bodies is able to provide such an effective barrier to the outside world\nscientists behind the research also hope their findings could eventually lead to stronger new materials that do not easily tear that could be used in aircraft , for example\nprofessor ritchie , a materials scientist at the lawrence berkeley national laboratory in berkeley , california , who was one of the co-authors of the research , said : ' our study is the first to model and directly observe in real time the micro-scale behavior of the collagen fibrils associated with the skin âs remarkable tear resistance\n' collagen fibrils and fibers rotate , straighten , stretch and slide to carry load and reduce the stresses at the tip of any tear in the skin\n' the movement of the collagen acts to effectively diminish stress concentrations associated with any hole , notch or tear\n' to conduct the experiment the researchers used the skin taken from dead rabbits , carefully removed the hair and placed it in equipment designed to pull the skin apart\nthey then cut a small notch or hole in the skin and watched how it changed shape as the skin was stretched in a way intended to cause the tear to increase\nhowever , rather than getting bigger as the skin tore , the notches simply yawned open\nthe researchers , whose work is published in the journal nature communications , then used the x-ray beams produced by the advanced light source at the lawrence berkeley national laboratory , to study the structural changes that took place in the skin\nthey found the collagen in the dermis , the thickest of the three main layers that make up skin , changed its alignment at the edge of the tear\nthe collagen , which is normally in a disordered tangle , straightened and began to slide against each other to absorb the stress and provide extra strength\nthe researchers found the collagen in the skin dermis changes from being a disordered tangle ( shown left ) to line up in straight parallel rows ( shown right ) when skin is damaged to provide strength and tear resistance dr marc meyers , a materials scientist at the university of california san diego who also took part in the research , said : ' straightening and stretching allow the uptake of strain without much stress increase , and sliding allows more energy dissipation during inelastic deformation\n' this reorganization of the fibrils is responsible for blunting the stress at the tips of tears and notches\n' research on skin 's mechanical properties dates back nearly 200 years , when physicians began examining stab wounds\nthe graphic above shows what happens to a notch in skin when it is stretched ( left ) compared to bone ( right ) unlike bone and teeth , which are also made of collagen fibres but tear and crack when under stress , the collagen in the skin appears to change its structure when placed under stress\nthe researchers behind the latest study are working with the us air force office of scientific research\nprofessor ritchie added : ' natural inspiration is a powerful motivation to develop new synthetic materials with unique properties\n' for example , the mechanistic understanding we âve identified in skin could be applied to the improvement of artificial skin , or to the development of thin film

thirds when taken correctly\n' however , there are many people who - for a number of different reasons - are unable to keep on a course of medication for depression\n' moreover , many people do not wish to remain on medication for indefinite periods , or can not tolerate its side effects\n' the first study of its kind discovered mbct is n't more effective than antidepressants but could offer similar protection - with no significant difference in cost\ninspired by ancient buddhist meditation , mindfulness courses were developed in the late 1970s by us doctors to combat stress\nthe guiding principle is to live more ' in the moment ' , spending less time going over past stresses and worrying about future problems\ntechniques include moving the focus of attention around the body and observing sensations that arise â the so - called ' body scan '\na secular practice , it is said to help people recognise and overcome negative thoughts while noticing small pleasures\nprofessor kuyken , of oxford university , said : ' depression is a recurrent disorder\n' without ongoing treatment as many as four out of five people with depression relapse at some point\n' mbct was developed to help people who have experienced repeated bouts of depression by teaching them the skills to recognise and respond constructively to the thoughts and feelings associated with relapse - thereby preventing a downward spiral\nin the study , 424 adults with recurrent major depression were split into two group at random - half remaining on antidepressants and the others coming off and receiving mbct\nthe latter group attended eight group sessions lasting two - and - a - quarter hours and were given daily home practice\nafterwards they had the option of attending four follow up sessions over a 12 month period\nthe mbct course consists of guided mindfulness practices , group discussion and other cognitive behavioural exercises\nthose in the maintenance antidepressant group continued their medication for two years\nall trial participants were assessed at regular intervals over two years for a major depressive episode using a psychiatric diagnostic interview tool\nalthough five adverse events were reported - including two deaths - across both groups they were not judged to be attributable to the interventions or the trial\nprofessor sarah byford , of king 's college london , said : ' as a group intervention mindfulness - based cognitive therapy was relatively low cost compared to therapies provided on an individual basis\nas many as four out of five people with depression relapse at some point , experts said\nan mbct course could be offered as an alternative to drugs ' in terms of the cost of all health and social care services used by participants during the study - we found no significant difference between the two treatments\n' professor kuyken added that although the mbct doid not work any better than anti-depressants , the results suggest a ' new choice ' for the millions of people with recurrent depression on repeat prescriptions\nstudy participant nigel reed , of sidmouth in devon , said : ' mindfulness gives me a set of skills which i use to keep well in the long term\n' rather than relying on the continuing use of antidepressants mindfulness puts me in charge , allowing me to take control of my own future , to spot when i am at risk and to make the changes i need to stay well\n' professor roger mulder , of otago university in new zealand who reviewed the study for then journal , said : ' because it 's a group treatment that reduces costs and the number of trained staff needed it might be feasible to offer mbct as a choice to patients in general practice\n' we therefore have a promising new treatment that is reasonably cost effective and applicable to the large group of patients with recurrent depression", "labels": "1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0", "summaries": "patients using mindfulness -

requiring huge amounts of energy\nbut the researchers say they have made a new material that can generate hydrogen from water , meaning it is less reliant on fossil fuels\nhydrogen - fuel is appealing for use in cars like the vauxhall zafira minivan pictured , but producing hydrogen requires huge amounts of energy\nwith the new breakthrough , it could be possible to make it more easily researchers at the university of bath and yale university created the invention\nit uses a newly designed molecular catalyst to split water in an electrolyser and create clean and storable hydrogen fuel\nlead research dr hintermair told mailonline that the main problem with the production of hydrogen through a process known as water electrolysis was the waste oxygen it produces\nwater splitting is an electro - chemical process in which two electrodes generate oxygen and hydrogen from water , respectively\nthe energy required to drive this process gets locked up in the hydrogen as the fuel with oxygen as a by - product\na fuel cell can then harness the energy again elsewhere by recombining the two\nthe new patented catalyst is more efficient at performing the crucial oxidation half of the reaction than any other existing material , minimising energy losses in the electricity - to - hydrogen conversion process\nit can be directly applied to various electrode surfaces in a straightforward and highly economical manner\nthe process splits water into hydrogen and oxygen but , while the first part can be done quite efficiently , the latter was more difficult and lots of energy is lost\nwith this in mind the team designed a catalyst - a substance that alters the speed of the chemical reaction - to improve the efficiency\nâ oxygen is the most difficult bit , â dr hintermair explained\ntheir catalyst , placed on an electrode used in the production of hydrogen , is much more efficient - and although dr hintermair did nât have an exact figure , he said the energy loss using it is â almost non-existent â\nthe major benefit from this breakthrough is that hydrogen could now be used more easily as a way to store energy from renewable sources like wind and solar\nâ we can make electricity out of sunlight and wind , low carbon renewable sources , but we ca nât store it very well , â dr hintermair continued\nâ we can put it in a battery but you ca nât , for example , fly an airplane on a battery yet\nâ so we need to convert it into a chemical fuel , and for that water electrolysis is a key technology because we can take any renewable technology , connect it to an electrolyster and store it in hydrogen , which is a fantastic fuel\nâ this , for example , would make hydrogen fuel cells for cars much more economical\non this right in this image is the catalyst being used in the water electrolysis process\nthe large bubbles are oxygen , while the smaller bubbles on the left are hydrogen the team are in discussions with a number of energy companies about utilising this technology on a large scale and hope the breakthrough marks the start of contributing to providing the world with more sustainable fuels\nâ in theory it could be used on all systems , but it depends on cost and scale , â said dr hintermair\nas regulations tighten on the use of fossil fuels and their emissions , there is a growing focus on the need for cost effective and efficient ways of creating energy carriers from renewable sources\nsolar power is thought to be able to provide up to four per cent of the uk 's electricity by the end of the decade\nhowever , while the price of photovoltaic technology has dramatically decreased in recent years as demand has risen , solar energy is problematic as it is intermittent , meaning electricity is only created when it is light\none use of the newly developed catalyst could be to store the energy produced by solar power by using the electricity to produce hydrogen which can then be used on demand , regardless of the time of day\nsolar power is thought to be able to provide up to four per cent of the uk 's electricity by the end of the decade ( wymeswold solar farm in leicestershire , uk shown ) , but storing it is difficult\nthis new technology could store energy as hydrogen , which can then be used on demand dr hintermair is a whorrod research fellow at the centre for sustainable chemical technologies at the university of bath\n' hydrogen is a fantastically versatile and environmentally friendly fuel , however , hydrogen -

their manager louis van gaal has not been too proud to learn from his mistakes\nhe was the only person in manchester , for example , who thought that rooney was a central midfielder and ander herrera a substitute\neventually he recognised his folly and man utd have improved\nvan gaal has also had the courage to pick players on form not reputation\nthis is why we now see falcao on the bench , daley blind playing ahead of the expensive shaw â regardless of shaw âs recent injury â and mata ahead of angel di maria\nat times , van gaal âs hand has been forced by injuries but his faith in players such as young and antonio valencia â players whose old trafford career looked over during pre-season â has its roots in what he has seen on the training field\nin many ways , this man utd team now resembles his dutch team of the world cup\nit seems to lack depth and real quality but still it manages to get the job done\nmata runs away in celebration after scoring one of man utd 's four goals against their great rivals city rooney , young and mata celebrate as they all rightfully earn their first - team places for man utd angel di maria ( third right ) and falcao ( right ) were left out of the starting xi by van gaal on sunday what has been the secret behind the renaissance of players like young and fellaini ? van gaal is a coach âs coach who believes in the value of the training ground\na man who swears by systems and training ground drills , the man utd manager has followed a mantra of â repeat , repeat , repeat â ever since he arrived in manchester and , at last , it has paid off\nin his early days at the club some of the man utd players worried that their new manager âs love of endless passing drills would eventually bore them to death\nsome even thought they were contributing to the squad âs spate of muscle injuries\nover time , however , van gaal âs belief in the value of repetition has worked and players like young , fellaini and indeed central defender chris smalling have particularly benefited\nman utd do not play predictable football but it is a game hung very firmly to a structure\nthat is one of the reasons why , for example , a back four without a single stellar player has conceded fewer goals than everybody bar chelsea and southampton this season\nfellaini celebrates scoring in this brilliant photograph taken by sportsmail snapper ian hodgson young celebrates after bringing man utd level having earlier trailed against city from the eighth minute players once moaned about , such as fellaini and young , are now pivotal parts of man utd 's team van gaal âs belief in the value of repetition has worked and players like young and fellaini have benefited did n't louis van gaal consider selling fellaini last summer ? yes , he did\noddly , it was only an injury that prevented the belgian joining napoli in loan last august but again van gaal âs treatment of fellaini has illustrated the value of flexibility and objectivity when it comes to managing players and teams\nvan gaal certainly has an ego but it is nât allowed to get in the way of decision making\nhe began the season convinced that 3 - 4 - 1 - 2 was the way forward for this man utd team and certainly there would have been no room for fellaini in that system\nbut time â not to mention performances â persuaded van gaal that there was greater value in other methods\nat city , pellegrini has been rather more stubborn\nover the course of the season the south american has refused to recognise the problems of using yaya toure as part of a central midfield pair and indeed the fact that his favoured 4 - 4 - 2 system can lead to his side being overrun in the middle of the field against really good teams\nfellaini helped as man utd tore city apart at old trafford to move four points clear of their noisy neighbours fellaini has illustrated the value of flexibility and objectivity when it comes to managing players and teams it was only an injury that prevented fellaini from joining napoli in loan last august from man utd should pellegrini be worried about his position at city ? 5-games lost by city in 2015 , one more than the whole of 2014\n13 - city 's position in the premier league form table after losing four and winning two of their last six\n4 - the first time since losing 4 - 3 to man utd in 2009 that city have conceded four in the league\n9 - city have nine points fewer than they did at this stage last season\n70.8 - city 's pass completion rate percentage at old trafford was their worst of the season\nas has been reported here before , city do not wish to sack their manager and it is still highly possible they may not\nhowever , footballers â body language can undo a manager almost as quickly as results and , from that point of view , the signs were bad for pellegrini at old trafford\nfor all man utd âs improvement , they are not a side that should be putting four past the champions but this was a city team seemingly unwilling to run , chase and do the ugly stuff on sunday and the club âs hierarchy have noticed\nit remains fashionable to blame players such as yaya toure for city âs failings and it seems inevitable the ivorian will leave this summer\nhowever , when players like david silva , pablo zabaleta and james milner start to disappear from the battle then you know you have a problem\nthere was a time when pellegrini âs level approach to life was viewed as one of his assets but at the moment there are those at city who are beginning to wonder when the chilean is going impose himself on a dressing room that has sleep walked its way towards calamity in recent weeks\npellegrini could be worried about his position at city after losing against their fierce rivals segio aguero , yaya toure and james milner look dejected as they await kick - off after a man utd goal frank lampard applauds the travelling fans off at old trafford as he and goalkeeper joe hart leave the pitch what does the summer hold for both clubs ?

age hunter gatherers in england were trading with continental wheat farmers 8,000 years ago - long before agriculture came to britain\nfarming is thought to have arrived in britain around 6,000 years ago so experts think that local hunter gatherers bought wheat by trading with europe farmers from as far away as the south of france or the balkans\nthis means that even 8,000 years ago there must have been trade routes winding their way across the europe continent to britain across an ancient land bridge\nthe scientists say that the discovery shows that britain was no - where near as isolated or insular as had been originally thought\nthey say the findings may also force a complete rethink about how agriculture first arrived in britain\ndr robin allaby , a plant geneticist at the university of warwick who led the research , said : ' eight thousand years ago the people of mainland britain were leading a hunter - gatherer existence , whilst at the same time in southern europe farming was gradually spreading across europe\nprevious studies have shown a link between the embrace of survival methods and the adoption of particular ornaments , so by looking at the ornaments , the experts were able to understand the spread of farming practices for the first time\nthey examined some 200 bead - type objects found at more than 400 europe sites over a 3,000 - year period , tracing the adoption of ornaments linked to farming populations in order to explain the patterns of transition from foraging and hunting to farming\nthey found that the pathways of the spread of farming over 3,000 years , are less clear than previously thought\nthey found ornaments linked to farmers , such as human - shaped beads and bracelets composed of perforated shells , from eastern greece and the black sea to france âs brittany region and from the mediterranean sea northward to spain\nbut the researchers did not find these types of ornaments in the baltic region of northern europe , according to the study , published in the journal plos one\nthis area held on to decorative wear typically used by hunting and foraging populations , such as perforated shells rather than beads or bracelets found in farming communities\ndr rigaud explained : â it 's clear hunters and foragers in the baltic area resisted the adoption of ornaments worn by farmers during this period\nâ we 've therefore concluded that this cultural boundary reflected a block in the advancement of farming -
