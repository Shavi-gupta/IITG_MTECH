makers that the unions â greed and bully - boy tactics all but destroyed the british economy , or that their beloved welfare state ( which has actually created a terrible dependency culture in many parts of the country ) relies on a strong , unsabotaged economy to keep it afloat\nthe film pride achieves a double whammy by venerating not one but two sacred cows of the left : bolshie unions and minorities ( in this case , homosexuals )\nnaturally , it does nât take long for the union bosses to recognise that the life - and - death struggle faced by gays and lesbians is very similar to that of their welsh colliery members\nstrangely absent from the story , of course , is any reference to the role the num played in bringing down successive british governments â both tory and labour alike â and its contribution to the terrible industrial unrest that gripped british in the seventies and culminated in the winter of discontent\nnor is there any mention of the attempt by arthur scargill , the loony - left leader of the num , to persuade communist russia â not to mention colonel gaddafi â to bankroll the strike , which his members had nât even had the right to vote for in a fair ballot\nbilly elliott is another film about â brave and downtrodden â workers whose lives are made miserable by the tories the same historical revisionism is exhibited in made in dagenham , about women workers walking out on strike at the ford car factory in east london in 1968 , demanding equal pay with male employees\nas with pride , the dramatic heart of the story is a conflict between two groups of left - wing activists who gradually learn to make common cause â in this case , male and female shop - floor workers\nat no point in the film is any sympathy shown towards the employers struggling to keep the firm competitive\nthe viewer is expected to assume that the demands of the strikers are completely justified\nmade in dagenham âs political message could nât be clearer , and it ends on a triumphant note with the passing of the equal pay act by a labour government in 1970\na more honest assessment of the british car industry would have featured the way union firebrands such as red robbo â â red robbo â â at british leyland helped to destroy it and did so much damage to the economy at large\nindeed , a more realistic ending to made in dagenham would have pointed out that the ford factory which once employed 40,000 people now has fewer than 4,000 , thanks , in part , to rising labour costs â pushed up by militant unions\nbrassed off starring pete postlethwaite and ewan mcgregor portrayed thatcher as an orge then again , that would have meant acknowledging the inconvenient truth that the trade unions played a big role in the postwar decline of british âs industrial base\nperhaps the most glaring omission from such left - wing propaganda movies is any concession that the policies of thatcher were a necessary corrective to the chaos and pessimism of the seventies\nthe fact is that her government inherited a country on the brink of political and economic collapse and restored it to rude good health , able to hold its head up high again in the world\nbut in so many left - inspired british films of the past 25 years , whether brassed off ( about a colliery band facing the closure of their coalmine by a tory government ) , the full monty or billy elliot , thatcher is portrayed as a wrecking ball determined to destroy traditional working - class communities and replace nice left - wing values with nasty right - wing ones\ninevitably , the period before thatcher is depicted as a golden age , a pastoral idyll straight out of a hovis commercial , while the british she left behind is portrayed as a money - grubbing spiritual wasteland\nis it any wonder that such films make ed miliband , brought up by a marxist academic father , â blub â ? the only exception to this disgraceful series of truth - twisting films was the iron lady , in which british âs first female prime minister was shown in a more nuanced light , almost in spite of its makers â left - wing instincts\nmade in dagenham is about women workers walking out on strike at the ford car factory in east london in 1968 , demanding equal pay with male employees\nit is broadly unsympathetic â there are plenty of scenes in which she is seen to be suffering from dementia , which suggests an element of hostility â but actress meryl streep brings such depth and humanity to the lead role that thatcher emerges as a more complex figure than the bogeyman of left - wing mythology\nnot surprisingly , the iron lady was condemned by many in the british film establishment for being â shallow â and â superficial â , an example of â self - important â film - making\nno doubt if it had depicted thatcher as a cruel monster , the same critics would have acclaimed it an out - and - out masterpiece\nthis mistake was corrected the following year by labour - supporting boyle\nin his lavish Â£ 27 million opening ceremony for the london 2012 olympics he made no direct reference to british âs greatest postwar prime minister â which was odd in itself â but left viewers in no doubt about his view of thatcherism\nonce again we were treated to the familiar left - wing version of british âs history , in which top - hatted tory industrialists , determined to despoil the country with dark satanic mills , are stopped in their tracks by an alliance of suffragettes , trade unionists and lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender activists\nboyle âs collaborator , frank cottrell boyce , condemned thatcher for being â insufficiently british â and said â although she draped herself in the union flag , she never seemed to understand this country â\nthe iron lady was condemned by many in the british film establishment for being â shallow â and â superficial â , an example of â self -
