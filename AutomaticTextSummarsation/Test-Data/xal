{"doc": "lauren crawley was given a new platinum implant facial palsy , or weakness of the facial muscles , can stop the patient 's eyelids closing properly\nlauren crawley , 54 , a housewife from kings langley , hertfordshire , was given a new platinum implant that makes it easier to blink again , as she tells thea jourdan\nthe patient a few years ago i started losing my sense of balance and developed tinnitus - my gp referred me for scans which showed i had a large but benign brain tumour behind my left ear\nsurgery was the only option\nthankfully the operation , in july 2012 , was a success\nbut my facial nerve , which was wrapped around the tumour , was damaged\ni 'd been warned that facial palsy could be a side - effect , but it was still a shock seeing my face in the mirror - the left side was droopy\napparently , it 's the same thing that can happen after a stroke\ni felt very self - conscious , but the problems were n't just aesthetic\ni 'd lost the hearing in my left ear as well as my sense of taste , and my mouth became dry\neating and speaking were difficult - and , worst of all , my left eye was permanently open and i could n't even blink with it\nto close it , i had to push the upper lid down with my hand\nthe eye itself was dry and painful\nto sleep , i had to seal it closed with tape\ni 'd been told that about half those with the condition do improve , so i was hopeful\ni tried lots of things to improve the muscle tone , including facial massages , taught by a physiotherapist\ni also had electric impulse therapy to shock the muscles back to life\nit was very stressful - i stopped socialising as much , in case people stared\nafter a year , it was clear the nerve would never work again so i was referred to raman malhotra , a plastic surgeon at the facial palsy clinic at the queen victoria hospital\nhe explained he could put a special platinum chain into my eyelid which would weigh it down and help it close by itself - i 'd be able to open the eye easily because the muscle controlling this was n't affected\napparently , surgeons used to use gold , but platinum is better because it does n't irritate the eye 's inside lining\nit is also more dense than gold , so you need only a thin chain , which meant people would barely see the implant through my eyelid\ni had the operation under sedation and local anaesthetic in february last year\nsurgery for a benign brain tumour behind her left ear damaged a facial nerve wrapped around it my eye was wide open as they injected anaesthetic into my eyelid and the skin around my eye , then made lots of tiny stitches into my eyelid to hold the chain in place\nit was strange watching it all but did n't hurt\ni went home that day , and the difference was immediately obvious\nthe eye gently shut , and stayed shut , of its own accord\ni could go to sleep without needing tape\ni ca n't feel the implant , no one can see it , and i can blink normally\nthe procedure has made me look more normal - people do n't stare as much\nit 's really boosted my confidence\nthe surgeon raman malhotra is a consultant oculoplastic surgeon at queen victoria hospital in east grinstead\naround 100,000 people in britain have facial palsy\nit can be caused by a stroke , if the stroke affects the area of the brain that sends signals to the facial nerve\nit can also be a result of traumatic injury , damage after surgery , or simply because of a virus damaging the facial nerve - this happens in bell 's palsy , which affects more than 28,000 people a year\nfacial palsy affects not just appearance , but lots of functions , too\nthe facial nerve - which rises from the bottom of the brain on both sides , then sends branches across the face - controls the tongue 's taste buds , for instance , and the salivary glands , so patients may suffer from dry mouth\nmost also have difficulty blinking , because the nerve controls the muscle that makes the eye blink shut\nhowever , it does not control the levator muscle , which holds it open\nwhile many patients will recover , with symptoms easing within eight weeks , lauren crawley 's facial nerve was too damaged to regain function\nwhen she first saw me , her left eye was wide and staring because the lower lid was also pulled down and sideways\nthis can cause all sorts of problems , from dryness to injury\nfive years ago , i would have recommended a gold implant - in the shape of a very thin bar - fitted under the eyelid to allow her to close the lid\nthe extra weight makes the eyelid heavier , so it closes automatically when the levator muscle relaxes\nthis procedure is used widely across the nhs\nbut i now believe platinum is much better\nit 's 10 per cent more dense than gold , so you can make the implant thinner without losing weight\nplatinum is also inert - gold will cause reactions , such as irritation and inflammation , in about 5 per cent of people\nthe left side of her face was droopy - until now i helped design a special system of individual links of platinum which we can join together with nylon to create a chain of the desired length and weight\nfor lauren crawley , i used three links weighing 0.4g each\nthis is much easier than stitching in a single bar of metal and then finding that it is too heavy or light\nthis way , we can easily add or remove a link\nin 2013 , we carried out a study at queen victoria hospital , using platinum chain implants on 18 patients\nonly two needed adjustments and 80 per cent said that they hardly noticed the implant , compared with just 20 per cent of patients who had a gold implant ( the study will be published in the british journal of ophthalmology )\nfirst , we anaesthetised the skin around lauren crawley 's eye\nthen , on a workbench , i linked the correct number of platinum links to form the weight i required ( i 'd previously done a trial run , sticking temporary weights to the outside of her eyelids to check the weight )\ni made an incision across the outside of her eyelid , where it makes a natural crease , making sure not to cut through to the eyeball\ni placed the links inside this incision , above the eyeball , stitching the chain in place from the outside in , before closing the incision\nthese nylon stitches stay in place for several years before being reabsorbed by the body\nby then , the links will be embedded in surrounding tissue\nwhen the chain was in place , and the eye was open , it sat above the eyeball so it did not come into direct contact with that delicate part of the eye\neven when the eye is shut , the implant does n't touch the cornea\nwhen lauren crawley wanted to blink , her brain switched off the levator muscle , which keeps the eyelid wide open\nthe corresponding muscle , the orbicularis occuli muscle , which should pull the eyelid down , does not work in lauren crawley 's case because it is controlled by the facial nerve\nthe percentage of stroke patients who are affected by facial weakness however , the new chain meant that the eyelid was sufficiently heavy to fall , thanks to gravity\nalthough it was n't a perfect solution - at first , lauren crawley 's eye closed more slowly than a fully functioning eyelid - at least she could blink again\nover time , the blinking gets better as muscle tone improves\nrisks include infection and bleeding , but these are rare\ni hope the implant will last lauren crawley a lifetime and that platinum implants will become the treatment of choice\nany drawbacks ? ' gold upper eyelid implants have been used for decades for facial palsy , ' says saj ataullah , a consultant oculoplastic surgeon at manchester royal eye hospital\n' platinum is more expensive , but seems to be better since it is inert and does not cause reactions\nand as the implants are less bulky , it 's also superior cosmetically\n' this chain segment innovation seems to work well\nany procedure can result in post-operative problems , but these appear to be rare\n' longer - term follow - up is needed before we can conclude that chain - link implants are truly superior to other platinum weights , such as bars\nbut they are promising so far\n' the operation costs around Â£ 3,000 privately\nthe nhs does not automatically fund it", "labels": "1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0", "summaries": "lauren crawley had surgery for a benign brain tumour behind her left ear\nwhile the op was a success , it damaged a facial nerve\nthe left side of her face consequently appeared droopy\nbut a new platinum implant has ' made her look more normal '"}

centre poster carrying his image at the time\nhad it done so then these fixtures would probably never have been the same again\nas it is , derby day now finds rooney even more fired up and motivated than ever\ncity have won the last four and one only has to scroll through the tapes to watch the england centre forward 's body language , especially during last season 's 4 - 1 reverse at the etihad , to see exactly how that has gone down\nrooney may be a liverpudlian but he understands the manchester city rivalry better than most at his club\nin stretford , rooney has the opportunity to ease united clear of pellegrini 's team\nwhen asked yesterday if he has a leader of the united captain 's ilk in his squad the city manager was less than convincing\n' every squad has different kinds of personalities , different players , ' said pellegrini\n' all of them have different options to motivate in different ways\n' i do n't think it 's good to analyse the personality of our captain\nin a squad you must have not just one leader , not just the captain\n' manchester city captain vincent kompany has been struggling with a hamstring injury but is expected to play against united , albeit with discomfort\nhe has admitted rooney 's volley of 2011 stayed with him for some time and it 's little wonder\nit remains a stand -

burning furnace , which will assist in losing those inches around the middle\ndo short bursts of high intensity exercise the most common excuse for not exercising is lack of time\nbut if you want to lose belly fat , you must exercise , full stop\ndoing short bursts of high intensity exercise leads to higher energy demands and more calories burned , which will help shed weight from the stomach according to a study from canada âs mcmaster university , high intensity interval training ( short blasts of exercise followed by short recovery periods ) enables you to achieve the same exercise benefits in less time than slogging countless hours on the treadmill\ntherefore , you can actually accomplish more by exercising less\nhow this will help you : high intensity interval training will create a positive knock on effect in terms of epoc , leading to higher energy demands for recovery and more calories burned for longer\nwrite down what you eat ( including how you feel two hours afterwards ) writing down how different foods affect feelings can stop a person mindlessly eating , mr staring claims busy lifestyles often mean that eating has become a required reflex , not a considered decision\nto get a sense of what you are consuming and how it is affecting you , try the following for 30 days â¦ 1\ntry on an outfit that currently does nât fit â take a selfie wearing this outfit\nstart writing down everything you eat , and the time you eat it , in a dedicated notepad\nbe diligent and keep this up for 30 days\nwhen you finish each meal , set your phone alarm for two hours later , then ask yourself 4\nrecord the results based on the following criteria : 5\nin 30 days , take the selfie again\nhow this will help you : watching your energy level patterns is an effective way to monitor your blood sugar levels\nkeep these levels consistent with carbohydrate timing , add in high intensity exercise , and the belly fat you want to be rid of will be a distant memory sooner than you think .", "labels": "1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1", "summaries": "personal trainer james staring advises how to achieve a flat stomach\nsays eating carbohydrates after exercise will stop them being stored as fat\nexercises that use more muscle groups will help speed up the metabolism\nwriting down how a you feel after food stops you eating mindlessly\nwhat is my energy level like ?\nhow full do i feel ?\ni have a high energy level / i feel satisfied and not hungry\ni have a moderate energy level / i feel just a bit peckish\ni have no energy / i could easily gnaw off my own arm i âm so hungry"}

0 defeat in the league on the day he celebrated his 30th birthday\nsometimes in training simeone likes to play a very special game of attack against defence\nhe lines up a first team back seven against 14 youth teamers\nhe âs proud of the first - team defences â ability to keep the ball out of their goal despite being outnumbered two to one\nwhether 14 youth team players amounts to more or less than gareth bale , ronaldo and karim benzema is open to debate\nbut then again those three were all on the pitch back in february for the 4 -

shift spears to intimidate rivals\nthis study said that chimps use shoots from alchornea hirtella to hunt aggressive army ants in a specific way\nit is thought that the behaviour is passed from one generation to the next and is learned by young chimpanzees\nwriting in the journal royal society open science , dr pruetz , a primatologist at iowa state university said : ' savannah - dwelling chimpanzees at fongoli , sã©nã©gal , are the only non-human population known to systematically hunt vertebrate prey with tools\n' acquiring vertebrate prey via tool use at fongoli supports the hypothesis that early hominins intensified their tool technology to overcome environmental pressures and that even the earliest hominins were probably sophisticated enough to fashion tools for hunting\n' the behaviour of these chimpanzees demonstrates that hunting is less adult male - biased among our closest living relatives than previously believed when tools are used\n' if tool use enabled early hominins to reduce the need for physical characteristics ( i.e. greater size , strength ) to achieve hunting efficiency , such sexual dimorphism ultimately becomes less important regarding prey acquisition\n' scientists first reported chimps using spear - like sticks to hunt prey at fongoli in sã©nã©gal in 2007 , and it was later filmed by the bbc in their hugely successful natural history series life story\nover the following years dr pruetz and her team have recorded 308 hunts using tools\ntools tended to be used when the chimps were hunting bush babies , called galago\nwhen dr pruetz and her colleagues analysed the hunts they had recorded , however , they found that more of them tended to be carried out by female chimps\nthe findings were surprising as most hunting behaviour is conducted by males and overall they account for 70 per cent of all prey captured\nthe chimps at fongoli in sã©nã©gal ( shown above ) are the only animals to regularly hunt for prey with tools\nscientists first reported chimps using spear - like sticks to hunt prey at fongoli in sã©nã©gal in 2007 , and it was later filmed by the bbc in their hugely successful natural history series life story researchers observed more female chimps using broken sticks like above to help them capture prey\nhowever , the male chimpanzees tended to capture larger prey and used their hands however , the male chimpanzees tended to capture larger prey and used their hands\nfemales carried out 61 per cent of the hunts using tools\nthey found that even in hunts involving tools , male chimps would often capture prey driven into their hands by those wielding tools\ndr pruetz added : ' what would often happen is the male would be in the vicinity of another chimp hunting with a tool , often a female , and the bush baby was able to escape the female and the male grabbed the bush baby as it fled\n' she added : ' it 's just another example of diversity in chimp behavior that we keep finding the longer we study wild chimps\n' other groups of chimpanzees have been seen to use tools in other ways to help them gather hard to reach food - such as using sticks to ' fish ' for termites\nagain these activities tend to be dominated by females , but dr pruetz said it could not be easily compared to the hunting behaviour seen at fongoli\nshe said : ' fishing for termites is a very different activity than jabbing for a bush baby\n' tool use by chimpanzees is now considered to be fairly widespread with many groups having been observed using stones or sticks to crack open nuts , fish for termites and in some cases to capture small mammals ' with fishing , termites grab on to a twig and do n't let go and the chimp eats the termites off the twig\n' when hunting , the bush baby tries to bite , escape or hide from the chimp\nthe chimps are really averse to being bitten by a bush baby\n' instead she believes there is something very specific about the open savannah environment compared to forests that has driven the chimps living at fongoli to use tools in this way\nshe said that hunting bush babies with tools may be a way of allowing them to get access to a highly nutritious food source without having to chase down their prey\nsomething similar may have happened with early humans as their environment changed to become more savannah like\nwriting in the journal , the researchers said : ' the savannah environment might be viewed as the catalyst for tool - assisted hunting by savannah chimpanzees in sã©nã©gal in that apes here exploit prey that is largely ignored by forest - dwelling chimpanzees\n' chimpanzees ' preferred prey at other sites , the red colobus monkey ( piliocolobus badius ) is absent in the dry , open savannah -
