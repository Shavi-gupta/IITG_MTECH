â a lot of small talk actually , â said bradley neil , who is trying to become the first british amateur since peter mcevoy way back in 1978 to make the cut\nâ there âs only six years between us , so we talked about girls and things\nstrangely , his life seemed to be a lot quieter than mine\nâ plan a called for the pair to play nine holes but bradley neil got the bonus of a further nine as mcilroy decided to play a full round\nperhaps he had one eye on the weather forecast , which is dire enough to wonder whether there will be any practice rounds at all\nthe highlight of bradley neil âs round came early , when he holed a 90 - yard pitch shot at the second for an eagle three\nmcilroy could not stop laughing\ntwo weeks ago during a private practice session here , bradley neil had done exactly the same thing\nmcilroy , who was also on a reconnaissance mission , was standing on the adjacent third tee at the time\nâ do yourself a favour bradley neil , and do nât ever go for this green in two , â said mcilroy\non the 18th , mcilroy finished in the style he will be looking for come sunday\na perfect drive was followed by a typically towering iron shot that finished just 10ft from the hole and he knocked in the birdie putt\nand so , late in the day , the attention switched to woods , where the crowd spoke as one\nthey were pleased to see him back\nmcilroy hits a tee shot at the practice session at augusta national golf club ahead of the masters ' start on thursday mcilroy and amateur bradley neil ( left ) practice their short game on the green at augusta national golf club on monday woods has not won a major since the open and will be keen to return to form as soon as possible europeans have been left behind perhaps someone will do a television mini series and call it modern masters mysteries\npart one would be what the heck has happened to the europeans at augusta national golf club\nand part two would be how left handers have managed to produce 50 per cent of the champions over the last dozen years while comprising barely three per cent of the field\nwhen jose maria olazabal collected the second of his two green jackets in such emotional circumstances in 1999 , it marked the 11th victory by a europeans in the 19 editions since seve ballesteros became the first in 1980\nthere has not been one since\nduring this millennium , the europeans have won four us opens , produced five open champions , while there have been four triumphs at the us pga championship\nthey have also won six of the eight ryder cups staged during that time frame\nbut at the major where they used to enjoy the most success ? there have barely been any serious contenders , let alone newcomers to the champions ' locker room\nlee westwood was runner - up to mickelson on one occasion while the swede jonas blixt finished joint second last year\nthat is it in terms of top two finishes\nwhy the dramatic shift in fortunes ? as mcilroy pointed out , part of the explanation has to come down to the fabulous augusta national golf club combination of woods and mickelson , who have won seven masters between them\nother than that , it is a hard one to fathom\nas the successes in the other majors showed , there has been no shortage of quality\nwhile the europeans have been shut out , the left handers have prospered like never before\nwhen the canadian mike weir won the 2003 masters he was only the second lefty to win any major ( bob charles , with his 1963 open triumph , was the other ) let alone the masters\nsince then , mickelson has weighed in with three victories before giving way to watson , who has won two of the last three , making it six victories out of the last 12\nit used to be said the perfect shape shot for augusta national golf club was a high draw but the lefties can better that since their equivalent is a high fade , and the ball always spins more and lands softer when the shot is a fade\nwhen you are dealing with the fine margins that prevail at augusta national golf club , that is a considerable plus\nthere is also paul mcginley 's geekish theory that the modern three - piece ball is harder to keep in the air when hit with a draw , thereby hurting the right handers at the masters\nmy own theory ? two left handers with perfect games for augusta national golf club just happened to come along at almost the same time\nboth have the power and the touch that is so vital to success in these parts\nbut when mickelson and watson are past their best , do not be surprised if we go back to the masters being dominated by those on the right\nnorthern irishman mcilroy hits a shot during the practice round prior to the start of the masters 2015", "labels": "1\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1", "summaries": "both woods and mcilroy took part in the practice session at augusta national golf club ahead of the masters 2015\nwoods was making his return to action and his first appearance for 60 days since taking a break from golf to regain form\nhe was given a warm welcome by the crowd and looked confident as he made his way around the course\nmcilroy , meanwhile , teed off with promising young british starlet bradley neil"}

who are often only offered running shoes in pink and pastel shades - while the primeknit fabric does look stylish and professional\nthe boost cushioning encompasses the shoe a bit like a hovercraft so they do n't make your feet look small and dainty\nbut while friends i met for a run did observe my feet looked big in the trainers , they also admired the fashionable appearance of the shoe\naldi : the supermarket 's trainers look the part and come in a bright turquoise and pink shade for women and royal blue for men\nthe appearance is reminiscent of brooks popular adrenaline running shoes so friends did n't guess they were made by aldi until i told them\nthe aldi trainers feature reflective material -

sharing site had ' censored ' their image and argued that it was a sexist move and it would not have happened had the shot been a picture of two men\nainsley hutchence , the agency 's director , said at the time : ' unfortunately instagram has ruled out natural hair that appears on all bodies of women that do n't trim their bikini lines\n' this hair occasionally does spill out of the sides of swimwear as it does on men in their underwear\nbut instagram seem to be ok with man pubes\n' he added : ' clearly this is absolutely sexist\ninstagram believes that women should wax or get off their platform\n' this shot , published by australian media agency sticks and stones , was banned by instagram for showing public hair\nthe agency said it though the image would have been published if it had shown two men when photographer kaur published a photo of a woman lying fully clothed on a bed with menstrual blood between her legs , the site removed it twice , saying that kaur was n't following ' community guidelines '\nother high profile bans include a protest by scout willis ( daughter of willis and demi moore ) who saw a photo of a jumper with two bare - breasted women on it removed from the site\nwillis said at the time : ' women are regularly kicked off instagram for posting photos with any portion of the areola exposed\n' while photos sans nipple â degrading as they might be â remain unchallenged\n' such ' unchallenged ' images might include the profile of us poker player dan bilzerian , who regularly posts near pornographic images of women alongside misogynistic language\nhis posts include a woman dressed in provocative school uniform -

strong following on instagram\nthe photo , which the singer tagged with the words ' # myhumps # babygotback # hungryshorts # onlyinmiami ' , shows a close shot of bublã© in the foreground while the rear of a female shopper was clearly in view\nin spite of a public apology and wide criticism , the image remains on bublã© 's site\nsuch ' unchallenged ' images might include the photostream of us poker player dan bilzerian , who regularly posts images of scantily clad women\nmany instagram users will be baffled as to why an image depicting a woman who is practically topless , as her shirt is tied beneath her bust , has been allowed to stay on the site\nbar two bits of tape on her nipples , the woman 's breasts are entirely bare , yet it falls within the rules , essentially on a technicality thanks to the strategically placed tape\nkendall jenner , meanwhile , posted a provocative that depicts the side of her entirely naked bottom , with a car balanced on the top of one cheek , yet despite the stipulation regarding ' close ups of fully -

this ranks among passengers â biggest fears , but mr applegarth said it is extremely unlikely , if not impossible , for someone to open the door as the pressure inside the plane is much greater than the pressure outside\nhe said : â this means the door is being forced closed\nnot even the world 's strongest man would be able to open it\nâ mr smith added : â in addition to any mechanical latching , most aircraft doors open inward before they open outward , and like a drain plug they are held in place by the forces of the pressurised cabin\nâ if a door were to open somehow the result would be a very quick decompression , though in all likelihood not a destructive or catastrophic one\nâ margins on the average economy class ticket are similarly thin , said pilot and author smith how much money does an airline pocket from each ticket sale ? a recent travelzoo study found that british airways â profit margin for each Â£ 690 ticket it sold for a flight from london to new york was just Â£ 4.24 , accounting for 0.61 per cent of the overall cost\nalmost the entire cost of the return flight went towards taxes , surcharges and operating costs\nmr smith said budget airlines probably make nothing from their super-cheap promotional fares , and margins on the average economy class ticket are similarly thin\nâ margins on a premium - class long - haul fare costing thousands of pounds , on the other hand , will be much higher , â he said .", "labels": "1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0", "summaries": "flying is a thrilling experience but is full of mystery for most passengers\nmailonline travel spoke to experts to answer common questions\nto reduce the risk of food poisoning , pilots do not eat the same meals\nlarger planes have private sleeping quarters for flight attendants\n' the world 's strongest man ' would n't be able to open a door mid-flight"}
