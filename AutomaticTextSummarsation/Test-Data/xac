life balance for those on zero - hours contracts were similar to other workers\nsome 60 per cent of people on zero - hours contracts do not want more hours , they said\nlabour and trade union leaders criticised the comments , saying it showed the minister was ' out of touch '\nshadow business secretary chuka umunna told mailonline : ' iain duncan smith 's ' marie antoinette ' moment today has revealed just how out of touch the tories are about the lives of working people\n' instead of acknowledging the worrying growth of zero -

hours contract\nbut the tories seem happy for working people to be stuck in low - paid zero - hour contract jobs\nit 's becoming increasingly clear throughout this campaign that they will only stand up for a privileged few\nthe reality â that the tories refused to acknowledge â is that for too many people zero - hours contracts leave them without a regular income and not knowing from one day to the next how much work they will get\nthe number of people with zero - hour contracts has increased by almost 20 per cent in the last year and surveys show that over half of young people on these contracts are on them because they could not find a job with regular hours\ncompanies such as sports direct are hiring the vast majority of their workers on zero - hours contracts , even though they have predictable and manageable fluctuations in demand and many of these employees reportedly work regular hours in practice\nthis is insecurity dressed up as flexibility\nit 's not acceptable , it 's not fair and labour will act to stop it\nlabour will ban exploitative zero - hours contracts\nwith labour , if you work regular hours for 12 weeks or more you will get a right to a regular contract\nwe will also give workers on zero - hours contracts new rights to be protected from employers forcing them to be available at all hours or cancelling shifts at short notice without compensation\nlabour is clear : we do n't need to rename exploitative zero -
