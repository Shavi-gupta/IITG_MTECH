crying\n' when his fever showed no signs of relenting after five days , trine took malcolm brabant to hospital\nthe doctors , who also discovered through blood tests that malcolm brabant had suffered recent liver damage , told him they believed he 'd had an adverse reaction to the vaccine\nhe believes the yellow fever vaccine could have dangerous side - effects they managed to lower his temperature\nbut his mental problems were only just beginning\nformerly agnostic , malcolm brabant became convinced he was jesus , and two weeks after being admitted to hospital he was moved to a mental hospital and given anti-psychotic medication\nit was a harrowing time for trine\n' one day i visited him in hospital and he stripped off his clothes and asked me to turn the sheet into a nappy and put it on him so everyone could see he was jesus , ' she says\n' doctors had told me not to upset him , just to do what he asked , so i did it\n' after three weeks , malcolm brabant was discharged in may 2011 , and seemed to be recovering , so went back to work\nbut within weeks he deteriorated again\nmalcolm brabant developed full - blown psychosis , and over the following months moved between psychiatric hospitals in different countries - in the uk , greece , and eventually with money running out , in trine 's native copenhagen\non one occasion he attempted to take his own life\nhappily , malcolm brabant was well enough to be discharged from hospital in july 2012 and has since made a full recovery\nhe is now pursuing the manufacturers of the vaccine , sanofi pasteur , to admit liability for what happened to him\nas trine explains : ' every doctor we dealt with said they thought he 'd suffered an adverse reaction to the vaccine\nsince may 2011 i have been back to sanofi pasteur many times , but they are refusing to do anything or even meet us\n' malcolm brabant is not the only person who believes they have had an adverse reaction to the drug\nhe is in touch with 12 others who believe they , too , have suffered grave side -

if a parent has it , there 's a 50 per cent chance their child will , too\nhowever , robin 's mother had type 1 diabetes , which is an entirely different type and so it 's likely to be just a coincidence\nin type 1 diabetes , the insulin - producing cells in the pancreas are destroyed , meaning none is released , whereas in type 2 the pancreas may produce decent levels of insulin but the body is resistant to it\nthe diabetes picture has changed dramatically since robin 's mother 's days\nrates of type 2 diabetes have soared , due to rising obesity levels , and it is being diagnosed at a much younger age\nin the uk in 2010 there were 3.1 m over- 16s with diabetes , 90 per cent with type 2\nby 2030 , there are expected to be 4.6 m people with the condition , equivalent to one in ten of the adult population\n' there is an epidemic of type 2 and the myth that this is a milder form of diabetes has been totally busted , ' says dr toms , consultant diabetes specialist at newham university hospital , east london\nindeed while complications such as nerve damage to the eyes and feet equally affect both types of diabetes , damage to the large blood vessels in the heart , brain and legs are far more common with type 2\nheart disease is a common complication of type 2 diabetes , because high blood sugar can damage the blood vessels and raise the risk of arteries becoming blocked\nonce he was diagnosed , robin was determined to do everything he could to limit the damage through lifestyle changes\npreviously his diet included meals grabbed from the catering truck while filming on location as well as late - night meals with friends while sharing several bottles of wine after coming off stage\nnow , he has eliminated sugar and refined carbohydrates such as white bread from his diet , and developed a passion for cooking from scratch\n' after being told about diabetes , i read up on it and was struck by michel montignac 's book , dine out and lose weight , which advocates giving up white ( refined ) carbohydrates ( that release sugar quickly into the bloodstream ) rather than counting calories\ni made the changes immediately\n' robin has since written a number of cookbooks for people with diabetes , as he found there was a lack of recipes available\nthe proportion of hospital beds occupied by patients with diabetes when filming for the current series of poldark , he took his own healthy breakfast\n' i travel with oats , walnuts , dried apricots and prunes to which i add almond milk , which is virtually sugar - free , and then i 'll have rye bread\n' robin 's other lifestyle change was to walk the recommended 150 minutes a week , little but often ( he 'd given up running by then )\nfor ten years he was able to control his blood sugar through these methods alone\nonly recently has he been put on medication , as diabetes is a progressive disease which worsens with age\nonly a minority of patients can combat the disease without drugs for so long\n' it is achievable , but only in patients who have the knowledge and motivation to do it , ' says dr toms\nsix years ago , robin was put on diamicron , a form of sulphonylurea drug , which stimulates the pancreas to produce more insulin\nthree months ago , he was also given januvia , which prevents the breakdown of the gut hormone glp-1 , whose role is to prompt insulin release after a meal\ntwo years ago , routine tests indicated that robin had possible artery problems and he was sent to a clinic\n' i arrived light -
