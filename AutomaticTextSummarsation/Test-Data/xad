{"doc": "teachers can judge the behaviour of black students more harshly than while pupils , new research has suggested\na study by researchers at stanford university examined the reaction of secondary and primary school teachers in the us to student race\nthey found that the teachers were more likely to view youngsters who they thought were black as troublemakers than those they thought were white\nteachers tend to see black pupils as more likely to cause trouble in the future if they have misbehaved in the past , according to new research that attempted to examine the impact of racial stereotypes in us schools the researchers say this may go someway towards explaining why black children are often disciplined more at schools compared to other pupils\nprofessor eberhardt , a psychologist at stanford university , said : ' the fact that black children are disproportionately disciplined in school is behind dispute\n' what is less clear is why\nwe see that stereotypes not only can be used to allow people to interpret a specific behavior in isolation , but also stereotypes can heighten our sensitivity to behavioral patterns across time\nsome of the world âs most troubling times , which have included periods of intense racism , have occurred during economic downturns\nand now a new study has found that people really do have a tendency to become more racist during a recession\nresearchers found that faces seem â blacker â and have stronger racial features during an economic downturn , and this in turn increases the likelihood of discrimination\nthe study by new york university claims that conditions of â resource scarcity â alter people âs perception of race\ntheir work follows a study last year , which suggested racism is on the rise in the uk , fuelled by financial strife\nin four experiments , involving 285 non-black us , scientists david amodio and amy krosch found people see faces different during an economic downturn\n' this pattern sensitivity is especially relevant in the schooling context\n' in their study , which is published in the journal psychological science , professor eberhardt and her colleagues presented teachers with fictional school records\nthese records described two instances of misbehaviour by a student\nthe teachers were asked about their perception of the severity , how irritated that misbehaviour would make them and how the student should be punished\nthey were also asked whether they saw the student as a troublemaker and if they could imagine themselves suspending that pupil in the future\nthe researchers randomly assigned names to the student records , in some cases suggesting the student was black with names like deshawn or darnell and in others suggesting they were white with names like greg or jake\nthe researchers found that racial stereotypes had little impact on the teachers ' views of the pupils after one infraction\nhowever , the second piece of misbehaviour was seen as ' more troubling ' when committed by a black student rather than a white one\nthe researchers examined the views of both primary and secondary school teachers to see if their opinions of fictional pupils were altered by racial stereotypes and found they tended to judge black students more harshly in the us black students are disproportionately punished for misbehaviour compared to white students the teachers also tended to want to discipline black students more harshly as they were more likely to see the misbehaviour as part of a pattern\nthe race of the teachers who took part in the study was not immediately clear , but mail online has contacted the researchers for more information\njason okonofua , who also took part in the study , said the findings had implications beyond the school system\nhe said : ' most social relationships entail repeated encounters\n' interactions between police officers and civilians , between employers and employees , between prison guards and prisoners all may be subject to the sort of stereotype escalation effect we have identified in our research\n' the researchers suggest that psychological interventions could be used to help change the stereotypes of black students influencing the way teachers treat pupils\nin 2005 trevor phillips , then the chairman of the commission for racial equality in the uk , suggested that black boys should be taught in separate classes in order to improve their educational achievements as a group\nhis controversial idea was met with opposition from some who said ghetto culture was to blame

{"doc": "the distinctive patterns on butterfly wings really do help protect the insects by mimicking the eyes of predators\nwhile scientists have long suspected the role played by eye - spots found on the wings of many butterflies were an example of mimicry , it has never been clearly tested\nrecently researchers suggested that the eye spots may simply scare away predators by confusing them or overloading their senses\nowl butterflies ( left ) have eye spots that mimic those of pigmy owls ( right ) to scare off predators like great tits\nwhile scientists have long suspected the role played by eye - spots found on the wings of many butterflies were an example of mimicry , it has never been clearly tested but a new piece of research by biologists at jyvã¤skylã¤ university in finland claims to have settled the debate\nthey say that eye - spots on the wings of butterflies do in fact mimic the eyes of larger and more threatening species , like owls\nhaving bright colours and distinguishing features is a common way for insects to scare away predators like birds\noften they help to lure them away from vital body parts or confuse them\nhowever , this only works on predators that hunt using sight while bats tend to be immune to such devices\nnow scientists have found that a moth has an unusual evolutionary adaptation that allows it to confuse the ultrasound used by bats\nthe luna moth has two tails that extend for more than an inch beyond its body\nscientists in the us showed that these appendages produce a confusing acoustic signature in the bats echolocation\nit makes the bats target the end of the tails rather than the moth itself\nthis helps to keep other birds that might normally eat the insects away\nthe team were finally able to test the theory by showing great tits pictures of owl butterflies that had been digitally altered , and watching their reaction\nimages where the eye spots had been removed from the butterfly wings did not stop the birds from snatching a mealworm snack below the picture\nhowever , when pictures that had not been digitally altered flashed on the screen , the birds were more weary\nand the researchers found the butterfly eye spots may even be more terrifying to the great tits than the real animal they are mimicking\nwhen shown pictures of a pygmy owl with its eyes open the tits reacted strongly and kept away , but their reaction was not as strong as with the butterfly markings\nwriting in the journal proceedings of the royal society b , dr johanna mappes and her colleagues said : ' in this study , the presumed model - owl eyes - and the mimic eyespots appeared to elicit similar reactions both in terms of response type - interest versus aversion - and its intensity - startle versus flee - adding support to the eye - mimicry hypothesis\nthe researchers flashed up digitally manipulated images of an owls face and the owl butterfly to see how great tits reacted\nin some images they removed the owls eyes ( far left ) or removed the eye spots ( far right ) eye spots are a common feature on butterfly wings , like the bycyclus anyana butterfly above , but scientists have been divided over whether they were intended to mimic other predators or simply confuse predators ' predator - prey interactions in nature often involve dynamic encounters between the partners , and eye spots are more likely to appear suddenly in front of the predator\n' their intimidating effect has been proved to increase when they are revealed abruptly\n' we therefore conclude that it is unlikely that the adaptive value of eye spots is due to sensory or information overload caused by the conspicuousness of colour pattern\n' the researchers conducted their experiments by placing wild captured great tits into a cage where the floor had been fitted with a computer monitor\nthe birds were offered a dead mealworm and as they approached an image was flashed up on the computer screen\nimages of owl eyes caused the birds to be startled , flee and in some cases give off alarm calls\nbut images of owls without eyes did not produce the same reaction\natlas moths ( above ) have colourful patterns on their wings that are thought to mimic the head of a cobra a cobra poses a far greater threat to a predator than an atlas moth and so by mimicking the reptile with the patterns on its wings the moth is able to scare off potential hunters that might make it a tasty snack however when the birds were shown images of the owl butterfly , they were also scared away\nif the irises of the eye spots were removed , or the eye spots removed altogether , then they were scared away far less often\nmany species of butterfly have eye - spots as part of the pattern on their wings\nthe atlas butterfly , for example , has a pattern that looks like the head of a cobra\nsome entomologists have also claimed that the eyed hawk moth look like the head of a fox when viewed from the front\nin one extreme example of mimicry , the caterpillar of the eastern tiger swallowtail looks like a snake and spits a foul smelling chemical to keep away predators\nlast year scientists at oregon state university looked at the butterfly bycyclus anyana and showed that it varies the intensity of its eye spots depending on the season\nthey claimed bright colours in the rainy season allowed the butterfly to confuse the dominant predators - preying mantids - while duller colours in the dry season helped them hide from birds\nsome entomologists claim the eyed hawk moth looks like the face of a fox or dog from the front the wing patterns of the eyed hawk moth is said to resemble the dark nose and the light coloured eyes of a fox", "labels": "1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0", "summaries": "biologists at jyvã¤skylã¤ university in finland studied how wild great tits reacted to images of the wings of butterflies and the faces of owls\nthe tits were startled and tried to flee at the sight of owl faces with open eyes , and butterflies that had eye spots on them that mimiced owl eyes\nthey say their study is evidence that butterfly eye spots mimic predators\nscientists have long debated whether butterfly eye spots were an example of batesian mimicry or if the patterns simply served to confuse predators"}
