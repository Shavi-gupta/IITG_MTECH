product of farming â into hydrogen gas , which can be used to power vehicles\nit âs previously only been possible to convert between 30 and 60 per cent of plant sugar into hydrogen , by using industrial catalysts or fermenting techniques , the independent reported\nthe ultimate aim is to produce large quantities of hydrogen from crop waste efficiently , because many present methods either cost too much or use food crops\nthe breakthrough could one day see the fuel being produced locally and drivers stopping to refuel their vehicles at roadside bioreactors instead of pumping petrol into their motor\nfor years , scientists have been working out how to develop fuel cell cars powered by pure hydrogen , but are unsure how to store the substance effectively\nnow , researchers from india 's benaras hindu university may be close to solving this problem using coconut kernels to store hydrogen in gas form\nstoring liquid hydrogen is notoriously difficult as it must be held at extremely low temperatures , which is expensive and tricky in the confines of a car\nto store it in its gaseous state , would mean that vehicles would have to be fitted with large , pressurised tanks , which is not practical\nso instead , experts have focused on finding materials , such as carbon , which can absorb hydrogen and release it on demand\nprofessor viney dixit and his team , at the university âs hydrogen energy centre created carbon from coconut kernels , which contain fatty and organic acids as well as potassium , magnesium and sodium\nhe says that the kernels , which are easily found , are cheap and can easily be converted into carbon\nâ unlike graphene , carbon nano tubes ( cnts ) and other type of carbons , the production of carbon from solid endosperm is not time taking , he wrote in a research paper\nâ therefore , its cost - effectiveness , good adsorption capacity and easy availability are its advantageous factors in regard to hydrogen storage\nâ the researchers found that the carbon produced from the kernels could store a â considerable â amount of hydrogen\ntwo scientists developed a process to make more efficient fuel by mixing biomass with a special solution comprising 10 enzymes that turn plant sugars into hydrogen and carbon dioxide\nthe enzymes were created in microbial fermenters using genetically engineered bacteria , which were then added to the plant waste and left for several weeks â although they would be left for far longer if the fuel was produced on a large scale\nthe breakthrough could produce a zero -

it be appropriate to apply enough force to potentially damage to the optic nerve\nrapaport , a dental surgeon with more than 30 years experience , said she was told to hold the patient 's head before the first punch\nshe said she was left in ' total shock ' and there were gasps from colleagues in the operating theatre as she gave a harrowing account of the procedure\n' he made his hand into a fist and he hit the patient in the face on the left side of his cheek\n' his hand was about six inches away\ni think the first time he punched the patient i was n't holding him and it was then that i was instructed to do so by prof peckitt\n' he said that when the patient fell out of bed , the cheekbone which was already fractured was moved outwards so he was trying to re-position it without having to make further cuts to the face\n' he said this at least after the first punch\n' he applied about ten punches like a boxer\nhe took aim and then punched\n' the first punch was unexpected and then he explained what he was doing\nhe spoke as he punched again and again\n' after graduating in medicine from the university of sheffield in 1979 , mr ninian peckitt completed further training with the royal college of surgeons of england and became a fellow of the australasian college of cosmetic surgery in 2009\nhe has lectured on titanium implants and been published in medical journals so miss

ipswich hospital when he punched a patient to correct a broken cheekbone\nhe later wrote the patient 's face had been ' digitally manipulated ' ' when i said it was like a boxer i meant he was carefully aiming where he wanted to hit\n' then he pulled his hand back to get the maximum hit as he touched the patient 's face\n' i can remember a feeling of total shock the first time he hit the patient because i was n't expecting it and i think anyone who saw what happened was reacting in a similar way and then he asked me to assist by holding the patient 's head\n' [ the punches ] were his fist aimed at the side of the patient 's face\n' he was looking himself and inspecting it and asked if anybody thought the fracture had moved\n' i understand generally it is nice not to have to make an incision but i do not understand the uncontrolled nature of hitting someone\n' i did n't challenge him at the time\n' miss rapaport added that following the operation , prof ninian peckitt told her to write that the cheek had been adjusted by ' external pressure ' in her operating notes\nshe said : ' prof ninian peckitt asked me to write up the note and i felt very challenged by what he had just done\ni asked him if he would write it and he said he would dictate the exact words for me to write down\n' he said \" the left malar was adjusted by external pressure \"\nthey were precisely his words\n' i particularly [ did n't want to ] write the note because accurately i would have had to write \" prof ninian peckitt punched the patient to try and move the left zygoma \" and that 's not something i would have wanted to do\n' i did n't challenge him\npartly because he is a consultant and partly because i was so shocked that i did n't have the strength to argue\n' i did n't see any damage , i just thought it was a very unusual technique\n' i was holding his head very still\nit must have moved a little [ when he punched ] but not much\n' prof ninian peckitt is much stronger than i am so i could only give as much support as i could so it might have moved a little\n' if i asked you to hold something still then i punched it , you do n't know how hard someone is going to punch so
