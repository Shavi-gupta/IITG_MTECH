cells that never lose the capacity to renew themselves - which help the skin heal\n' if you compared a wound on the outside of a man 's arm , where the hair follicles are larger and more numerous , with a wound on the inside of the arm , the one on the outside would heal better , because of the increased stem cells and blood supply , among other factors , ' says professor tobin\nsimilarly , a bald scalp is less able to cope with nicks , cuts and bruising than a hairy one because of the lack of healthy follicles\nas we age , follicles shrink and while people who lose hair will still have some stem cells , their healing capacity may be reduced\nthe good news is that removing hair through shaving or waxing wo n't reduce these benefits because the hair follicles are still intact\n... and provides sun protection body hair harks back to our prehistoric ancestors - it was our only garment , keeping us warm and protecting us from environmental impact such as sunlight , explains nick lowe , consultant dermatologist from london 's cranley clinic\nwhile few of us have dense enough hair to serve this purpose now , someone who 's particularly hairy may have an extra degree of sun protection , he says\nanother historic function of body hair was to keep us warm , says professor tobin , who is also director of the centre for skin sciences\n' we do know bald heads lose more heat , and that when we 're cold , our body hair stands on end to trap warm air closer to the surface of the skin\n' body hair harks back to our prehistoric ancestors - it was our only garment\nnow , experts have revealed the various ways in which being hairy may be good for us - despite our constant attempts to remove it do n't pluck your nasal hair unsightly as they may be , hairs in the nostrils do have a role - to prevent foreign material , such as dust , getting in to the nose and lungs , says murty , an ear , nose and throat consultant at university hospitals of leicester\nif you want to defuzz your nostrils , trimming might be better to plucking , particularly if you have a cold , adds mr murty\n' when you pluck , you 're pulling the root out , which leaves a hole in the skin - that 's a potential source of infection , so you may want to avoid plucking when there 's lots of infections around '\nsurprisingly , the tip of the nose technically has the most dense patch of hair on the body\nwe 're born with all our hair follicles - 5 million of them\nas we grow into adults , the hair on our limbs becomes spaced out , but the tip of the nose stays a relatively similar size , explains professor tobin\ndoes a hairy chest imply intelligence ? those who are particularly hairy - such as the actor tom selleck ( pictured ) - may have extra sun protection an ample chest rug has long been seen as a sign of masculinity and good health in a man\nand there may be something in it\nas boys and girls go through puberty , some of the light , unpigmented hair on their bodies - called vellus hair - becomes thicker and darker , under the influence of hormones such as testosterone and its derivative dihydrotestosterone , becoming what is known as terminal hair\nas men tend to have higher levels of these hormones , they usually have more terminal hair , and in more areas than a woman , such as the face , abdomen and chest\nso when a man has a good smattering of chest hair it could be a sign that he has healthy levels of testosterone , says nida chammas , a consultant endocrinologist at bmi the clementine churchill hospital , harrow\nhowever , not having much chest hair does not mean a man is unhealthy , she adds - it can be simply down to your genes\nsomeone with less obvious body hair may have perfectly healthy levels of male hormones , but the receptors in the skin are less responsive to them\nsome research links the hairiness of a man 's chest to his intelligence\nin the nineties , aikarakudy alias , a u.s. psychiatrist , claimed that hairy chests are more likely to be found among doctors than the general population - he found 45 per cent of male trainee doctors were ' very hairy ' compared with less than 10 per cent of men generally\nbut professor tobin is sceptical , saying unless factors such as race , ethnicity and socio - economic status were ruled out , such findings were meaningless\nwomen who use hair removal creams around their bikini line may find they are more prone to thrush why it pays to stay au naturel another function of hair is it provides a ' slippage zone ' , preventing chafing in areas where skin surfaces rub against one another\nironically , these are often areas where people may be most keen to be hair - free - such as the armpits and bikini area\n' even the finest hair coverage on the body provides this glide buffer zone , ' says professor tobin\n' so , some people who shave under their arms find it 's uncomfortable to move their arms against the side of their body - like a carpet burn\n' meanwhile , women who use hair removal creams around their bikini line may find they are more prone to thrush , a common yeast infection that causes itching , irritation and discharge , says ugwumadu , a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist at st george 's hospital , london\n' some people may have allergies to these products\nan allergic reaction may then precipitate inflammation which triggers an episode of thrush\n' repeated hair removal in this area , whatever the method , can sometimes cause a minor infection called folliculitis - disrupting the hair follicle may allow bacteria to get into the hair 's root\n' because there is a high concentration of follicles in this area , and increased sweat ( on which bacteria feed ) , the chances of an infection are higher , ' says mr ugwumadu\nhairy toes may mean good circulation losing the hair on the feet - and also the lower leg - can be a symptom of peripheral artery disease it 's rarely considered an attractive feature , but hair on your toes could be a sign that your circulation is in good working order\nkyriakides , a consultant vascular surgeon at barts health nhs trust , explains : ' losing the hair in the feet - and also the lower leg - can be a symptom of peripheral artery disease\n' in this common condition , a build - up of deposits in the leg arteries restricts blood supply to the leg muscles\npatients with it are more likely to have heart disease , too\nhair follicles need a good blood supply for nutrients and oxygen\n' if you get a blockage in the circulation in the legs , it means less oxygen will reach the bottom of the leg - far away from the heart - so the hair follicles there will suffer the most\n' however , some people simply are n't very hairy on their toes anyway , and they do n't need to worry\n' it 's only a sign of poor circulation if you had hair there in the first place , ' says mr kyriakides\nsuch hair loss usually happens to people for whom peripheral artery disease is quite advanced - an earlier symptom is pain in the calves when walking\nleaving underarm hair intact may help disperse the odours that attract us to a potential partne think before you prune your ears hairs in the outer portion of the ear canal prevent dust and other particles from entering the ear\nhowever , excess hair in the ears may collect wax , which can block the ear canal and hamper hearing - so if you are prone to build - ups of ear wax you may want to consider trimming these hairs\nbut this may affect your hearing , according to dr krishan , an anthropologist at panjab university , chandigarh , india\nhe suggests there are two types of tiny sensory hairs which help transmit sound signals to the brain\nthose in the outer ear boost soft sounds and reduce the loud sounds , while those in the inner ear transmit the sound waves to the auditory nerve\nwriting in the journal medical hypotheses , dr krishan suggests very hairy ears could confer better hearing\nhowever , ent experts are deeply sceptical\nlovelorn ? hairy armpits may help another argument for leaving underarm hair intact is that it may help disperse the odours that attract us to a potential partner\nas professor tobin says : ' in other mammals , body hair is very important for dispersing odours , such as pheromones - chemicals that can help to attract mates\n' whether humans have them too is a controversial area , but shaving your underarm hair could mean that odours are not dispersed into the air so quickly\n' ps. go easy on the fake eyelashes good news for bushy - browed cara delevingne - the thicker your eyebrows , the better protected your eyes are from sweat and other particles\neyelashes , too , are important for keeping dust out of eyes , as well as helping them stay moist\n' they redirect air flow over the eye lid and keep it out of the eyeball , stopping it drying out , ' explains professor tobin\nhowever , you do n't want eyelashes that are too long\na recent study from the georgia institute of technology in the u.s. found that if they are any longer than a third of the width of your eye , they 'll actually increase the air flow around the eye and have a drying effect .", "labels": "1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0", "summaries": "miley cyrus challenged convention and left her underarms unshaved\nthis may help disperse the odours that attract us to a potential partner\nhair on your toes could be a sign that your circulation is good"}

life version of ice planet hoth featured in star wars sequel the empire strikes back\nbut astronomers from ohio state university pointed out that the same planet orbiting a sun - like star would be in the ' habitable zone ' where conditions are potentially suitable for liquid surface water and life\nand based on this latest ' snowball earth ' , it could suggest there are many more planets that resemble ours 2.4 billion years ago\n' these events are fascinating\nwe had times where we really had a completely frozen snowball earth , â dr daniel herwartz told discovery news\nâ if you go now to tropical regions and you imagine thick glaciers and all the oceans frozen , it âs crazy i think , but it appears to be that this has happened\nâ this theory can also help explain a period in snowball earth âs history known as the great oxygen transition , 2.2 billion years ago\nhere , oxygen levels began to rapidly rise from 0.0001 per cent of present levels to the 21 per cent of the atmosphere we see today\nrapid melting across the entirety of snowball earth could have given rise to these increased levels of oxygen in the atmosphere\nevidence for this latest theory comes from oxygen isotopes studied in rocks in china and russia\nthe exact causes for why the entire snowball earth seemingly froze over are not clear , though\nspeaking to mailonline , dr herwatz said before 2.4 billion years ago , the climate of our snowball earth was â normal â -

more cool , allowing the ice to spread\nvolcanic eruptions - or even a supervolcano - could also have reduced the amount of light reaching snowball earth , allowing temperatures to drop\nit appears that volcanic activity was ultimately responsible for helping snowball earth breaking free of its icy grip , though , increasing global temperatures\nin fact , dr herwatz said the amount of melting probably caused snowball earth to go through a â supergreenhouse period â\nthe â snowball earth â theory is not set in stone , though -

several different theories have emerged over the years to explain the similar fingerprints of earth and the moon\nperhaps the impact created a huge cloud of debris that mixed thoroughly with the earth and then later condensed to form the moon\nor theia could have , coincidentally , been isotopically similar to young earth\na third possibility is that the moon formed from earthen materials , rather than from theia , although this would have been a very unusual type of impact\nthis cloud would have been composed of some earth material , explaining the similarity between earth and the moon , and other material\nâ this means that , right after the moon formed , it had exactly the same isotopic composition as earth 's mantle , â said dr walker , a professor of geology at university of maryland and co-author of the study\nboth bodies have a similar isotopic â fingerprint , â notably similar types of tungsten , suggesting they had a similar origin\none difference , though , is that earth has proportionally much less of a lighter isotope known as tungsten-182\nthe team said this is because after both bodies formed , earth swept up more debris that had little tungsten-182\nâ we still need to work out the details , but it 's clear that our early solar system was a very violent place , â added dr walker\nthe team said their theory largely rules out the idea that the mars - sized body theia was of similar composition , or that the moon formed from only material contained in the pre-impact earth\nthe other studies , though , disagree\nscientists at the israel institute of technology and the southwest research institute in colorado said that theia actually had a similar composition to earth\ndr alessandra mastrobuono-battisti and colleagues simulated collisions between protoplanets and compared the composition of each surviving planet with the composition of its last giant impactor\nin one theory , a team of scientists at the university of maryland said that the impact of theia with earth was so violent , the resulting debris cloud mixed thoroughly before settling down and forming the moon\nshown is an artist 's illustration of the young earth and moon the university of maryland team examined the tungsten isotopic composition of two moon rocks collected by the apollo 16 mission , including sample 68815 , seen here\nwhen corrected for meteoritic additions to earth and the moon after formation of the moon , the two bodies had identical tungsten isotopic compositions supporting evidence includes the earth 's spin and moon 's orbit having similar orientations\nmoon samples indicating the surface of the moon was once molten also provide evidence , as does the moon 's relatively small iron core\nthe moon also has a lower density compared to earth , while there is evidence of similar collisions in other star systems ( that result in debris disks )\ngiant collisions are also consistent with the leading theories of the formation of the solar system\nand finally , the stable isotope ratios of lunar and terrestrial rock are identical , implying a common origin\nthey found that 20 to 40 per cent of impactors had similar compositions to the planets they impacted , whereas planets that formed in the same simulation tended to have distinct compositions\nthe authors suggest their results may explain the similarities between earth and the moon - and why their compositions differ from those of other planets in the solar system\nâ we find that different planets formed in the same simulation have distinct compositions , but the compositions of giant impactors are statistically more similar to the planets they impact , â the researchers wrote\nthey said their theory has a 20 per cent probability of correct\nwhichever theory turns out to be correct though , both are in agreement that the formation of the moon remains a confusing mystery that is yet to be fully solved\nâ this is interesting stuff and no one has all the answers regarding the formation of the moon - we certainly do n't claim to , â dr walker , one of the authors of the former study , told mailonline\nhowever , the other theory says that earth ( left ) and the moon ( right ) are so similar because the initial mars - sized object , theia , actually had a similar composition to earth\ndr alessandra mastrobuono-battisti and colleagues simulated collisions between protoplanets to make their finding", "labels": "1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0", "summaries": "the moon formed when a mars - sized body called theia hit it early on\nbut no one is sure why the moon and earth have a similar composition\nuniversity of maryland researchers say cloud of debris rained on worlds\nbut israel institute of technology says impactor was similar to earth"}

but nothing could have prepared her for the moment when someone offered to sell her a baby over dinner while she was working undercover in india\n' it was the most heartbreaking experience that i ever had , ' gianna toboni told daily mail online\nbaby business : vice correspondent gianna toboni ( pictured ) traveled to india to explore the country 's booming gestational surrogacy industry shady deal : the journalist from brooklyn , new york , went undercover to meet with an agent in india who offered to get her a baby in two to three months but the heartbreak did not end there\nas gianna toboni quickly learned during her time working on the outsourcing embryos documentary , surrogacy in india is a multi-million dollar business , and one which is made all the more lucrative by the high number of american couples traveling to the country in order to use the services provided by one or more of the â embryo outsourcing â agencies featured in the vice documentary\nduring her time spent undercover posing as one of these people , gianna toboni was informed that , in order to maximize profits and ensure a final product , doctors are encouraged to implant multiple embryos in surrogates , which can lead to the surrogate having to abort one of the fetuses or give birth to multiple babies\nand if an ' extra ' baby is born , it is n't necessarily going home with its genetic parents\nthere are also issues with couples never making it to india to claim their children for whatever reasons , meaning that the newborn baby is left without a parent\nfor the most recent episode in the vice series , gianna toboni went undercover to meet with one surrogacy agent who claimed over dinner that she could get her a caucasian baby in two to three months - confirming that there were in fact â extra â babies being sold on the black market\nthe agent then tried to convince gianna toboni and her team to buy the baby that they had brought with them to the restaurant\nshocking offer : one of the agents can be seen holding the baby that they brought to the restaurant with them no morals : the agent eventually offered to sell gianna toboni and her team the baby over dinner gianna toboni noted that the agent spoke with a ' shocking amount of ease ' and ' talked about forging documents as if she has done it a hundred times ' as she tried to sell her and her team a baby over dinner\n' it made me think it was n't a one - off thing , ' she explained to daily mail online\ngianna toboni never once considered buying the baby , but as a woman who would one day like to be a mother , she admitted that there was a moment when she thought about accepting the offer , knowing that she could provide the child with a loving home that it may never experience otherwise , particularly as it was made clear that the agent would have sold the baby to anybody\n' when i go on these stories , i am a human being first and a journalist second , ' she said of her initial reaction to the offer\nthe sale of ' extra ' babies on the black market was just one of the many shocking side effects of commercial surrogacy uncovered by gianna toboni and her team\nin the american , surrogacy can cost hopeful parents upwards of $ 100,000 , and gianna toboni explained that ' the reoccurring theme ' when speaking with american agents and experts about couples hiring surrogates from other countries was money\ncommercial surrogacy in india costs nearly one - sixth the amount it would in the western world\n' that seems to be the main driver , ' she explained , before noting that some prospective parents do choose foreign surrogacy because of the altruistic element\nno options : many of the surrogates who spoke with gianna toboni said that they decided to carry a baby because they desperately needed the money dormitory : the women who agree to be surrogates at dr patel 's akanksha infertility clinic have to live at the facility until they give birth tight quarters : two surrogates can be see sitting on the beds in their shared room and while american parents see the surrogacy business in india as being a â cheap â alternative to the services offered at home , the amount of money made by a surrogate in india can vastly change her life , as well as the life of her family\nwomen can use the money to buy a home or send their own children to school , and gianna toboni explained that there are in fact couples who take great efforts to make sure their surrogates are a part of their lives\nbut there are also countless tales of financially desperate women who are recruited in the slums and coerced into signing contracts that they ca n't read , only to be duped out of the money they were promised\nwhen i go on these stories i am a human being first and a journalist second surrogates undergo scheduled cesarean sections so doctors can ensure the greatest number of births per day\ngianna toboni , who witnessed the high turnover rate first hand at dr patel 's akanksha infertility clinic , in the town of gujarat , in the west of india , was nearly speechless when she saw how rapidly newborns and their parents were whisked away following a surrogate 's c - section\ndr patel maintained that the women are well taken care of and make more money than they could working 24 hours a day , seven days a week , in any other profession\nand while gianna toboni explained that some women are happy that they can provide a house for their family and put their kids through school as a surrogate , the women she and her team spoke to said they chose to be surrogates because they did n't have any other options\nduring the episode , a surrogate named vasanti told gianna toboni : ' nobody likes doing this\n' dishonest : although dr patel maintained that she did n't search for surrogates from the slums , gianna toboni met a woman who said she was working for the clinic owner as tried to recruit women from a poor area no choice : a doctor can be seen performing a cesarean section on one of the surrogates\nsurrogates have to undergo c - sections so doctors can maximize the amount of babies being born in a day too quick : almost immediately after this baby was born via a surrogate , the biological parents whisked the newborn away in a van as they went to return to their home country she continued : ' i did n't have a home , so i thought i could build one by being a surrogate\nâ another surrogate named nisha explained that she was ' helpless ' and had ' no alternatives '\ngianna toboni was overcome by many of the surrogates ' desperation\n' it is really hard to hear someone talk about going through an experience that takes a toll on the body , that lasts longer than nine months and takes them away from their kids because they have to support their families and essentially survive , ' she said\ngianna toboni recalled speaking with one surrogate 's husband who recently lost his job and he confessed that he was grateful his wife had the opportunity to earn money for their family as a surrogate\nhe made clear that he did n't force her into the role , but explained that it was necessary for their family 's survival\n' it all went back to money , ' gianna toboni noted\nas a whole , gianna toboni said that she thinks some parents may be aware of the ' shadier side ' of commercialized surrogacy , but a ' vast majority â have no idea this dark underbelly exits\ngianna toboni recommends that parents who are considering foreign surrogacy options should do extensive research on the agent , the doctor and the surrogate they will be working with .", "labels": "1\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1", "summaries": "vice correspondent gianna toboni traveled to india to explore the country 's booming gestational surrogacy industry for the hbo series\nin the american , surrogacy can cost hopeful parents upwards of $ 100,000\nmany american couples are hiring surrogates in india because the cost is signficantly less than it would be in the western world"}

something that was later picked up by william shakespeare\nshe said were no surviving descriptions of richard iii 's distinctive physique from during his lifetime\ninstead she says that his appearance became increasingly distorted through out the tudor period\ndr lund said : ' stage history has reincarnated richard iii as monster , villain and clown , but recent events have helped us to re-evaluate these physically defined depictions and strip back the cultural accretions that have surrounded his body\nthis reconstruction of richard iii , based on his skull , has revealed what the king looked like 500 years ago scientists studying the skull of richard iii ( above ) found he had suffered several brutal blows before he died scientists used 3d scanning to reconstruct how richard iii 's ( right ) skeleton may have been deformed ( left ) ' the care he in all probability received for his scoliosis from his surgically trained physician was large in scale : traction and manual manipulation needed specially designed equipment , space and assistants\n' yet , it may have been only a relatively small group of people in richard iii 's trusted circle who knew of his condition\nthe absence of contemporary testimony does not prove this , however\n' what is certain is that , after his death , the exposure of richard iii 's body went beyond the two days of its exhibition in leicester\n' that moment after battle of bosworth field inaugurated a longer and more brutalising process , in which an ever - more twisted physique was revealed to the public eye , his own body becoming deployed as a major tactic in the rhetorical strategy against him\nthe skeleton of richard iii , with the curve in his spine clearly visible , was found under a car park in leicester ' when william shakespeare 's richard iii boasts of his shape - changing potential , he registers too the bending course of history and myth making\n' analysis of richard iii 's skeleton , which was discovered buried in a shallow grave at the site of grey friars abbey in leicester in 2012 , showed that many depictions of the king 's appearance had been exaggerated\na 3d reconstruction of his spine showed that it had 65 to 85 degrees of scoliosis - a sideways bend of his spine to the right\nthe condition would have developed in his early teens , but was far from being a hunchback\nthe scientists at the leicester who examined the skeleton said there was also little evidence that the king would have walked with a limp\nhowever , there are some that point to the alleged murder of richard iii 's nephews edward v and richard of shrewsbury - the so called princes in the tower - as evidence of the king 's character\nthey say this act of infanticide is what earned the plantagenet king his blackened reputation rather than his physical appearance\nthe blow that killed richard iii in battle was so powerful that it went up through the base of his brain and left an indentation on the inside of his skull , scientists studying his remains have revealed\nforensic pathologists at leicester , discovered two wounds at the base of the king 's skull along with a large indentation inside the cranium\nthe findings suggest that a weapon such as a sword or a spike had been thrust upwards through the base of the king 's neck so hard that it had gone straight through his brain to the other side of his skull\ngenetic analysis of the battle scarred skeleton , discovered under a council car park in leicester three years ago , has confirmed that it did belong to richard iii scientists studying the remains believe the king was surrounded by a mob of enemy soldiers and hacked to death after he had lost his helmet\nusing modern medical scanners , they established that the english monarch suffered 11 devastating injuries at the battle of bosworth field in 1485 .", "labels": "1\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0", "summaries": "historian dr lund believes richard iii used good tailoring and clever armour to hide the scoliosis in his spine that curved to the right\nshe argues his condition only emerged when he was stripped after death\nscientists who examined richard iii 's skeleton say the king was far from being the hunchback portrayed by william shakespeare in his plays\ndr lund says the king 's name was probably blackened after death in battle"}

of - four teresa , from eaton bray , bedfordshire , is the first to admit she was naive about horse ownership â and as a result has been left frantically trying to find a home for her 16 - year - old daughter elise âs irish cob beau , without success\nâ none of us realised the financial commitment of owning a horse , â says teresa\nâ we did nât have any land so found him a field and stables which cost Â£ 80 a month\nâ then there is beau âs food and hay , which can cost up to Â£ 100 a month , and the regular Â£ 30 charge to keep his hooves trimmed\nâ we âve at least been lucky that he âs been healthy , so the vet bills have been low , but vaccinations are still Â£ 260 a year , â she says\nâ it began to get more and more of a stretch to care for him\nâ sara cooper 's back pain forced her to give up her beloved horse pip ( pictured together left )\n' on average , i was paying Â£ 160 a month to rent a field and a stable\nit was Â£ 10 for a bag of feed which lasts two or three days ' the situation reached crisis point last summer â by when teresa had taken a part - time cleaning job to help fund beau âs care , while elise had started work as a trainee hairdresser to help out , too\nâ but it still was nât enough money\ni thought : â i ca nât do this any more â â i âve got four children and there are other priorities , â says teresa\nâ it âs been a difficult decision , but the truth is beau is a luxury we ca nât afford\nâ so , earlier this year , the family made the reluctant decision to put him up for sale\nyet months on , there still have been no takers â though the family is adamant they will not abandon him\nteresa âs experience chimes with that of sara cooper , 33 , a trainee agricultural assistant from wiltshire\nthe mother - of - two has always loved riding her 20 - year - old horse pip , but last year had to stop after being kicked by a cow , leaving her with back pain\nâ riding now exacerbates the pain and i simply ca nât afford to keep a horse that i ca nât ride , â she says\nâ on average , i was paying Â£ 160 a month to rent a field and a stable\nit was Â£ 10 for a bag of feed which lasts two or three days\nâ long - time rider melanie , a 54 - year - old self - employed carer from barnstable , devon , says rocketing costs drove her to give away her beautiful 14 - year - old cob , connie and so , like teresa , she had to make the painful decision to get rid of pip , selling him to a family in buckinghamshire\nthe price of hay has risen far beyond inflation , with some farmers putting up a bale by Â£ 5\nit is a cost hitting busy animal sanctuaries harder than ever\nfiona , who runs tower hill stables animal sanctuary in tillingham , essex , is overseeing 50 abandoned or neglected horses\nâ we have had them left tied up outside the sanctuary gates , â says fiona , 48\nâ we âve found horses in such a pitiful state that it makes you want to weep\nâ like the beautiful palomino pony , found in a coal shed , skeletally thin , cast aside when she was too old to be ridden\nâ she would have been every little girl âs fantasy in her prime , but once she had outlived her usefulness she ended up in this appalling state , â says fiona\nâ melanie found it so difficult to find a buyer for horse connie , at one point she considered having her put to sleep\n' the thought broke my heart , but i did nât know what to do , â she says long - time rider melanie , a 54 - year - old self - employed carer from barnstable , devon , says rocketing costs drove her to give away her beautiful 14 - year - old cob , connie , who she could nât afford alongside her other horse , flossie\nat one point last year , she became so overwhelmed that she contemplated having connie put to sleep\nâ the thought broke my heart , but i did nât know what to do , â she says\nin the end , after many frantic phone calls , melanie found a local stud farm , who took connie to breed from\nâ i was lucky , although it was devastating\nbut a lot of people abandon their horses as they do nât know what else to do and think it âs the kinder option\nâ well - meaning or not , fly - grazing is now heartbreakingly common and many owners do not comply with laws requiring them to microchip their horses , making tracing them impossible\nso it is left to animal sanctuaries to take in the poor creatures â if they are discovered in time to save them .", "labels": "0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0", "summaries": "increasing costs mean few owners can keep up with looking after a horse\nwith dwindling buyers more horses than ever are being abandoned\nlast year , the rspca alone took in 1,500 , many of them family pets"}

neither oestrogen nor progesterone are inherently bad for mood\nthey 're both beneficial for mood because they boost neurotransmitters such as serotonin\n' i 've worked with thousands of pms patients , and i 'm convinced : pms is not caused by hormones , or even by the drop in hormones ( which is inevitable at the end of the menstrual cycle )\ninstead , pms is caused by your individual response to that drop in hormones\ndr lara briden has been a naturopathic doctor specialising in women 's health for 20 years ' this is where it gets interesting\nyour response to hormones depends on the health and resilience of your hormone receptors , which are the tiny docking stations for your female hormones , and are found in every tissue , including your brain\n' your hormone receptors translate hormonal messages into real physical effects such as mood or appetite\n' when your receptors are healthy , they 're flexible , and they adapt to rising and falling hormone levels by simply dialling up and dialling down their response ( depending on the level of hormone )\n' when your receptors are not healthy , on the other hand , they can not adapt to changing hormones , and that leads to premenstrual symptoms\n' fortunately , we know what impairs the health of hormone receptors : chronic inflammation\naccording to a recent study , blood markers of inflammation are higher in pms - sufferers\nchronic inflammation is a kind of long - term immune activation that is caused by different things including stress and smoking\nit 's also caused by certain inflammatory foods , and that 's why diet is so effective as pms treatment\n' off the table : deep fried and sugary foods are the most inflammatory , and therefore should be avoided eat fewer inflammatory foods the most inflammatory foods are deep - fried foods and high - sugar foods such as desserts and sweet drinks , so you should avoid those\nyou should also avoid fruit juice because it is concentrated sugar\nsugar and deep fried foods are inflammatory for everyone , but other foods , such as wheat and dairy products , can also be inflammatory if you have a sensitivity to them\nfood sensitivities are well known to cause symptoms such as sinus or eczema , but they are also a common cause of pms\ntry avoiding wheat and dairy for three months , and see the difference\nif in doubt , speak to your doctor or nutritionist\ntip : pms is a common symptom of food sensitivities\neat the rainbow : brightly - coloured fruits and vegetables such as berries , spinach and kale provide essential nutrients such as folate and magnesium eat more anti-inflammatory foods the foods that actively reduce inflammation are fruits and vegetables , especially the brightly coloured ones such as berries , spinach , and kale\nfruit and vegetables are anti-inflammatory because they provide essential nutrients such as folate and magnesium , and because they provide phytonutrients\nphytonutrients are beneficial plant compounds that stimulate your immune system and to reduce its inflammatory response\nsupplements : dr lara briden recommends mineral magnesium and vitamin b6 to supplement diet supplement with natural anti-inflammatory nutrients my favourite anti-inflammatory nutritional supplement is the mineral magnesium\ntogether with vitamin b6 , magnesium has done extremely well in clinical trials for premenstrual syndrome\nboth supplements are safe and easy to obtain\ntip : the no - more - pms diet works to prevent pms\nplease follow it during all the days of your cycle - not just when you 're premenstrual\nlara briden is a naturopathic doctor with nearly 20 years experience in women 's health\nshe 's just released her new book period repair manual : natural treatment for better hormones and better periods .", "labels": "0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0", "summaries": "no - more - pms diet consists of anti-inflammatory foods and nutrients\nthe eating plan was devised by naturopathic doctor lara briden\nresearch indicates that pms is caused by unhealthy hormone receptors\nhealth of hormone receptors is impaired by chronic inflammation\nstress , smoking , and eating certain foods are all causes of inflammation\ncutting inflammatory foods can result in dramatic improvement in pms"}
