again , don mclean is n't saying\nwhat he does do , however , is give excellent advice to songwriters who are just starting out : ' immerse yourself in beautiful music and beautiful lyrics and think about every word you say in a song\n' were the lyrics ' the father , son and the holy ghost ' a nod to john f. kennedy ( left ) , robert kennedy and martin luther king ( right ) , whose assassinations occurred in the sixties ?

he was studying at religious schools and became the highest - ranking rabbi in judea\nthe radical revision of christian history would suggest that , in preaching the spurning of worldly possessions for an austere life , jesus christ may have been speaking from experience\ndr bradford has analysed the bible 's original greek and hebrew scriptures to try to establish the truth about jesus christ 's background\nhe says a mistranslation of the greek word ' tekton ' to describe the profession of joseph , jesus christ 's father , is one of many mistakes that have led to a fundamental misunderstanding of jesus christ 's character\ndr bradford claims that while ' tekton ' is usually said to mean carpenter , it more accurately means master builder or architect\nas an architect , joseph would have had a higher social status that enabled him to better educate his son\nroman historian tacitus later mentions jesus christ and his execution with pontius pilate in his annals , thought to be written around 116ad\nboth mentions were a considerable time after his alleged execution\nmr fritzgerald also takes issue with many of the stories about the crucifixion that stem from the first gospels of mark , matthew and luke\nhe said : ' there are many examples of inconsistencies in the gospels that suggest they were written by people who did not live in judea at the time they are set\n' mark makes many mistakes about life and geography during the first century in judea\n' if jesus christ really had been arrested on the eve of passover , they would probably have just put him in jail and tried him after the weekend\n' the trial itself violates the rules of jewish law - why was he not stoned ? ' what we know about pontius pilate also suggests he was someone who would not do what the jewish asked him and would often do what they asked him not to\n' instead mark portrays him as being persuaded by the jewish leaders to execute him\n' mr david fitzgerald argues that many of these stories were in fact incorporated into the story of jesus christ as literary devices rather than as a historical account\nhe said : ' there is also no evidence for the tradition that sees barabbas - an anti-roman rebel and murderer - being released while jesus christ , an innocent , is condemned to death\n' what this actually seems to be is mark using the story as an allegory for the yom kippur scapegoat ritual where one goat is released into the wilderness and the other is sacrificed for god\n' mr david fitzgerald hopes to have his new book ' jesus : mything in action ' out later this year\nhe added : ' it still puzzles me that as soon as anyone tries to pin down who jesus christ is we get 50 different jesus christ 's emerging", "labels": "1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0", "summaries": "atheist writer david fitzgerald claims there is no evidence jesus christ existed\nthe san francisco based author instead says jesus christ was a literary allegory created by combining old jewish stories and rituals along with rival cults\nhe insists it is time to stop believing in jesus christ as a historical figure"}

{"doc": "his penchant for topless scything has proved a hit with housewives around the uk - and sent many rushing to social media to declare their love for actor turner , 31\nbut it seems not everyone is a fan of the gardening techniques featured on poldark - not least the mowing community who have complained about turner 's ' excessive sweating and grunting ' and say it should never be done shirtless\nturner set hearts aflutter when he stripped off to manfully mow a hay field with a scythe , an ancient cutting tool used for centuries prior to horse drawn and modern mowing machinery\nthey say turner âs macho grunts and terrible technique as he hacked at the hay tarnished the view of the usually ' sedate ' action of scything\nexpert scyther riley , 56 , says in real life , turner would have run out of breath long before completing the filed - and he would have kept his shirt on to protect him from the sun. ' when the poldark episode in question aired , word got around our network of scythe enthusiasts very quickly that there had been this scene in it where turner used a scythe , ' he says\n' it was accompanied by a lot of comments saying his technique was nât very good\nthe story of poldark highlights the romantic aspect of the scythe and its use in history but we were nât very impressed with turner âs scything\n. that 's how it 's done : mr riley demonstrates how scything should really be done surely not ? mr riley brushed off comparisons with poldark and compared himself to iggy pop instead that 's more like it : turner 's shirtless poldark has been setting hearts aflutter on sunday nights ' there was a lot of sweating and grunting going on but the only time you âd mow like that would be in a competition\n' mr riley , from gillingham in dorset , also questioned whether turner had been shown how to use a scythe properly before the cameras rolled\n' scything is an efficient and poetic way of cutting rather than the way it was portrayed on poldark where it was this very aggressive , manly action\n' using a scythe should be a sedate , pleasurable activity rather than an arduous , backbreaking chore\nit can be zen - like if you âve got a sharp blade and good technique\n' that was how the programme makers wanted to portray it but it was clear to us that there was nât much effective work being done\n' the grass and flowers in the meadow were nât flying everywhere , which you might expect if someone was good with a scythe\n' i would guess that aiden turner had not been shown how to use a scythe properly before filming\nif an experienced scyther were to put the same amount of energy into it as on poldark they âd be getting an awful lot done\n' a work rate like that is also not conducive to keeping the action up all day , but that was obviously in conflict with how producers wanted the scene to look\n' mr riley also raised questions about turner âs lack of shirt , claiming a real scyther would keep their clothes on to protect them from the elements\nexhausting : mr riley says poldark puts too much effort into his scything and would n't finish the job smooth move : fellow expert simon fairlie , from dorset , shows off his skills in a west country meadow the 56 - year - old , who runs courses in how to wield a scythe , added : ' the fact that he had no top on was not particularly realistic - if you were in the field all day and wanted to protect yourself from the sun you would nât take your shirt off\n' there are times when it is ok to scythe topless , like if you are in competition , but i âm more iggy pop than aiden turner\n' meanwhile ... female fans take to twitter to complain about the lack of shirtless mowing in last night 's episode of poldark female fans of bbc 's cornish period drama poldark are complaining after dashing actor turner kept his shirt on in last night 's penultimate episode\nmany have taken to twitter to voice their upset after the irish hunk , who plays captain poldark , went a whole episode without revealing his chest\nin previous episodes the star has been seen scything topless and skinny dipping in the cornish sea\nwhere are the abs ?

invisible pollen descends\nexperts told mailonline that five million people are expected to fall victim to the symptoms - which include streaming eyes , incessant sneezing and irritating itches at the back of the throat - for the first time\naround 20 million people in the uk are expected to suffer hayfever symptoms this summer , up a third from last year , experts told mailonline and by 2030 that figure is expected to surge to 31.8 million sufferers\ndr emberlin , a leading pollen expert , told mailonline that a 33 per cent rise in the number of people struck by hayfever this year could occur , ' depending on weather conditions '\nshe said : ' if we get prolonged periods of warm , dry weather with intervals of some wet weather between , which helps the grass to keep growing , we will experience a lot of high grass pollen counts\n' grass is the main culprit pollen for hayfever in the uk\n' high and very high pollen counts can trigger hayfever symptoms in people who have not had them before\nshe added : ' in addition , the good weather typically brings increases in air pollution , which can make symptoms worse , and again lead them to occur in people who have been symptom free before\n' in addition , she said pollen is becoming more potent , and greater numbers of plants giving off the allergens is also contributing to a rising number of sufferers\ndr emberlin said another contributing factor is that the average hayfever season is becoming longer , typically stretching from april to the end of august\nshe added : ' there is substantial evidence from pollen monitoring records and from vegetation surveys to show that the timing of some of the pollen seasons has been changing in the uk and across europe over the last few decades\nhayfever seasons in the uk are becoming longer , as warmer weather in spring and autumn means pollen is typically rife from march to the end of august ' in addition there has been a trend to longer pollen seasons and increasing pollen loads of some types\n' globally , average surface temperatures have increased by about 0.7 Â° c over the past 100 years , leading to earlier plant growth in many regions\n' the trend towards warming has been more pronounced in winter months , resulting in more changes in the timing of spring pollen seasons than those of summer and autumn\n' hayfever is an allergic reaction to pollen and spores\nit happens when the immune system mistakes these harmless airborne particles to be a danger and launches a defence against them\nthe body produces an antibody and histamine is released which causes the typical symptoms of sneezing , runny nose and eyes , an itching nose and mouth , and possibly a blocked nose\nthe allergy is a seasonal one , triggered by a range of different pollens ranging from tree to grass , weeds to fungal spores\nby 2030 , dr emberlin predicts there will be 31.8 million sufferers as the situation will worsen\n' as summers become warmer more photochemical smogs will occur on dry days resulting in an increased frequency of days with high concentrations of ozone , nox and other pollutants that will make symptoms worse , and that will make people more susceptible to allergens , ' she said\n' due to climate change in the future , plant growth may be influenced in a way that more , new and altered pollens are produced , which may affect humans\n' dr emberlin , speaking on behalf of opticrom hayfever eye drops , warned the season is expected to start suddenly with pollen counts surging from almost nothing to very high in a matter of days\nfriday is set to be the hottest day of the year so far , with the mercury poised to rise steadily to reach 21 Â° c in parts of southern england\nin preparation , hayfever sufferers are being encouraged to take action , stocking up on antihistamines and other treatments to lessen the impact of their symptoms\n' it is very important to know the seasons , when it is likely to peak and the days when pollen levels will be particularly high\n' knowing when the season is about to start means there is lots a person can do\n' if you are not sure of the best treatment you can speak to your pharmacist or gp\n' steroids are often used to treat hayfever , but they are best taken before the onset of symptoms\ndr emberlin said : high and very high pollen ( pictured under the microscope ) counts can trigger hayfever symptoms in people who have not had them before ' ' antihistamines are also commonly used and it is a good idea to get them in and ready to use when the season starts\n' if you have got a big event , like exams or a wedding coming up you can ask your gp to prescribe a short course of steroid tablets to keep symptoms at bay\n' there are lots of options available , the key is just to be organised and ensure you are prepared\n' on days you know the pollen count is high make sure you take antihistamines before you leave the house , and wear sunglasses to keep pollen out of your eyes\n' make sure you wash your clothes regularly and do n't sleep with the window open\n' dr emberlin said pollen counts can suddenly surge if conditions are right\n' a warm day with a slight breeze can

term tiredness\n' it can interfere with the contraceptive pill and some other medications - but it 's definitely something that i suggest patients should consider\n' before taking st john 's wort , check with your pharmacist or gp\ndr mike dixon says he is a ' fan ' of herbal medicines because they are ' safe ' ( posed by model ) hypnotherapy for bowel trouble professor peter whorwell , a gastroenterologist at the wythenshawe hospital in manchester , specialises in helping people with severe ibs ( ibs )\n' by the time they come to me most other treatments have failed , and i recommend hypnotherapy to probably 70 to 80 per cent of them as part of a treatment package including medication , diet and lifestyle changes\n' it works on about 80 per cent of those who try it\nibs involves abnormal muscle spasms of the gut and hypersensitivity of the gut to pain , and is aggravated by stress\nhypnotherapy tackles all three of these causes\n' i have been taught self - hypnosis to help me sleep when my mind is whirring\ni think it 's a skill every doctor should learn\n' turmeric for aches and pains dr uzma ali , an nhs who also works at the integrated medical centre in london , explains that as a child she was always given a glass of warm milk with half a teaspoon of the spice turmeric if she fell over\ndr uzma ali was always given a glass of warm milk with half a teaspoon of the spice turmeric if she fell over ' only now do i know why that was - turmeric contains an ingredient called curcumin which has been found to have a powerful anti-inflammatory action\n' now , if i see patients with problems like sports injuries , back pain , whiplash , fibromyalgia or sciatica , i suggest that they add a supplement of curcumin to their treatment - or , if they ca n't take painkillers , that they use it as their primary remedy\n' my favourite remedy is called dehlvi 's haldi capsules , which contain turmeric , but you can buy turmeric / curcumin capsules in health stores - or just add more to your cooking\n' acupuncture for migraines dr tanvir jamil , a gp at burnham health centre , near slough in berkshire , has been treating his patients with acupuncture for years\n' i mostly offer this to patients for pain relief - particularly migraine\nif medication or lifestyle changes such as reducing stress are n't working , acupuncture will often help\ni normally give patients one session a week for four weeks\nthe number of gps in britain who practise homeopathy ' i combine chinese acupuncture - which works along energy lines called meridians in the body , that chinese practitioners believe become imbalanced during illness - and western acupuncture , which concentrates the needles where it specifically hurts\n' so for migraine , i 'd use the needles around the face , either side of the eyebrow , the cheek and just under the ear - along with points in the hands\n' i decided to learn acupuncture when i was a junior doctor over 20 years ago\nthe evidence is good enough that the government health watchdog , nice , recommends acupuncture on the nhs for migraines\n' i have had acupuncture myself for neck pain in the past\nexactly how it works is n't known but my personal theory is that it somehow stops the nerves being as sensitive to pain signals\n' it 's a once - a - week treatment and there are no side - effects - it could save the nhs a fortune if it was used more widely\n' yoga for skin complaints every morning dr stefanie williams , a dermatologist and medical director of european dermatology london , does ten to 15 minutes of yoga and 20 minutes ' meditation at lunchtime\n' both help my stress levels and also benefit my skin , ' she says\n' the stress hormone cortisol raises levels of inflammation in the skin - and this not only triggers faster ageing but aggravates conditions such as acne , eczema and rosacea\nthe stress hormone cortisol raises levels of inflammation in the skin - yoga can alleviate this ' for this reason i also advise my patients , whether they are coming to me for skin problems or merely for cosmetic procedures , to try yoga or meditation as part of their treatment plan\n' they are often surprised by the idea , but many have experienced their skin flaring up when they are stressed , so once i explain the science behind why that happens they are very keen to include it\n' homeopathy for indigestion most conventional doctors are highly sceptical of homeopathy , questioning the idea that minute amounts of a substance that triggers symptoms can also be used to treat those symptoms\nnot so dr tim robinson , a gp in beaminster , dorset , who has been a gp for 25 years and a homeopath for 20\n' i use homeopathy myself - most commonly nux vom , which i take when i get indigestion - and i do suggest the remedies to some of my patients\n' it is helpful when conventional medication has nothing to offer , or where it 's contra - indicated\n' for example , if i have a menopausal woman coming to see me with hot flushes and she ca n't take hrt because she has had breast cancer , or has been using hrt for the recommended two to four years and must come off it , there are a few homeopathic remedies i can suggest - belladonna being the most common\n' homeopathy is also useful for chilblains - there are topical orthodox treatments for this but they are n't very effective\n' the idea behind homeopathy is that dilute forms of substances that cause the symptoms of a condition can also help to treat it\n' in a study of 20,000 people by bristol homeopathic hospital , 70 per cent of them said they felt a positive benefit", "labels": "1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0", "summaries": "the government 's drug regulator has approved a ' herbal remedy '\nphynova joint and muscle relief , contains sigesbeckia\nthe traditional chinese herb is traditionally used to treat aches and pains\ndr uzma ali advises patients with aches to take a curcumin supplement"}
