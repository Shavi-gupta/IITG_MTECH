possibly even as intelligent as modern humans , homo sapiens\nthere are a number of theories for what caused neanderthals to disappear - but most seem to agree it was the arrival of modern humans in europe and asia that played a role\nsome archaeologists believe they were unable to compete with modern humans , while others believe humans actively killed them\nneanderthals vanished relatively quickly once modern humans arrived in the areas where they were living however , dna evidence also suggests that neanderthals and modern humans also interbred\nneanderthals use of fire is still a highly controversial issue , but if they had not used it to cook food as much as modern humans it would have put them at a definite disadvantage\nmiss goldfield said : ' there is certainly plenty of evidence that neanderthals used fire in europe as well as in the levant , africa , and elsewhere\n' i was absolutely not suggesting that neanderthals had no use or control of fire\nwhat we do n't know is how intensively the populations used fire\n' what is an intriguing problem is the seeming lack of consistent fire use in the quina mousterian , a glacial phase of the middle paleolithic\n' we see a bit of burned bone at some sites , but really no evidence for lots of fire use\nit may be that we have n't found it yet , or it may be that neanderthals were using other survival strategies\n' neanderthals probably were n't all that different from humans , but they may have adopted different strategies for dealing with their environment\n' miss goldfield , who conducted her research with ross booton , a mathematical biologist at the university of sheffield , suggests that with their bigger bodies , neanderthals would have needed more food than modern humans\nrecent research is suggesting that neanderthals were sophisticated and not very different from modern humans , increasing the mystery behind why they died out and homo sapiens managed to survive she said : ' my real aim was to specifically look at the impact of cooking on metabolism , and whether regular cooking of food might have been an advantage for neanderthals\n' neanderthals were a bit more muscular and robust than early humans\nneanderthals metabolic costs for a day 's activity would have been a bit higher\n' using their computer models they were able to simulate how the populations of neanderthals would change depending on their use of fire\nthey found that if modern humans used fire more often than neanderthals , then their populations would grow\nboth groups hunted and ate reindeer , among other large prey , that were prevalanet across much of europe at the time\nbut as modern human populations grew , it would also reduce the number of reindeer available for neanderthals\nover time this could have increased neanderthals vulnerability to extinction\nmiss goldfield presented her findings at the annual meeting of the society for american archaeology in san francisco\nshe said : ' initial tests indimcate that cooking lean meat increases its caloric value sufficiently to offset up to 3.7 days â worth of locomotion , or 12 kills per year , thus extending the carrying capacity of a landscape patch , particularly during periods of resource scarcity\n' she told livescience : ' fire use would have provided a significant advantage for the human population and may indeed have been an important factor in the overall collapse or absorption of the neanderthals population", "labels": "0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0", "summaries": "researchers used computer models to study how neanderthal populations would have fared if they did not use fire to cook and modern humans did\nthey found cooking would have increased the number of calories available\nevidence for neanderthals using fire is patchy and not all may have done it"}

4khz range while the gibbon hoos were consistently below the 1khz threshold\ntiger and leopard hoos were similar , suggesting that callers perceived these two predators as belonging to the same â big cat â class\nwhile both gibbon sexes displayed similar hoo calls , female calls were lower in frequency than male ones\nthe researchers say this is surprising , as among mammals , males tend to have lower frequency voices than females\nfemales also typically did not produce hoo vocalisations when encountering neighbours and often remained passive\nthis video shows a white handed gibbon singing the more distinctive and audible calls while in a zoo enclosure males , however , often interacted with neighbouring individuals\nthe gibbons also seemed to use whispering during more intimate moments - much like humans do too\nwriting in the journal bmc evolutionary biology , dr clarke and her colleagues said : ' duet hoos tended to be higher in frequency than the other contexts , significantly so when compared with feeding , leopard , tiger and raptor hoos and raptor and tiger hoos\n' the researchers say the study is of direct relevance for the on -

specific is necessary for communication to direct the attention of others\nthis behaviour appears to be widespread and was likely present in the ancestor of modern primates and humans\nthe acoustic variation seen in gibbon hoos in particular may be similar to human speech , in which subtle acoustic parameters , like pitch , can be important carriers of meaning\nchimpanzees bash out distinctive drum solos on the roots of trees as a form of ' signature ' and to tell others in their group where they are\nbiologists studying the primates have found over the years that male chimps grip the buttresses of tree roots with their hands and beat them with their feet\nthe noises produced -

term exposure to high levels can affect kidneys\nbut mercury poisoning is very rare , suggests dr mahendra , a consultant haematologist at the queen elizabeth hospital , birmingham\n' in 27 years as a haematologist i have never been asked to test for mercury , ' he says\ndentists agree that when fillings are being put in or removed , the mercury can release vapour\nthis is absorbed into the bloodstream in the lungs and then taken to the kidneys to be passed out harmlessly in the urine\nblood tests showed she had high mercury levels\nwith nothing else to account for these raised levels , her fillings were pinpointed as the cause but the amounts taken in from fillings is ' minuscule ' , says salford dentist dr atkins\nindeed , a review by the eu commission 's scientific committee in 2008 concluded there was no risk from amalgam , says professor walmsley , the british dental association 's scientific adviser\namalgam is ' strong , durable and adaptable ' and there is ' no evidence to suggest these fillings are anything other than safe to use ' , adds stjohn crean , professor of medicine in dentistry and an oral and maxillofacial surgeon at the university of central lancashire\nit is true that mercury can sometimes cause sensitivity and soreness in teeth -

a condition which causes an adverse reaction to gluten , found in wheat , barley and rye\nfollowing blood tests , it was discovered that she had high mercury levels\nwith nothing else to account for these raised levels , her fillings were pinpointed as the cause\n' all i could think of was i had to get rid of them , ' says jameela\nbut while she expected her symptoms to immediately subside once her fillings were removed , they continued to affect her over the next few years\n' i hated the fatigue , the headaches , the fact i should have been fit and healthy but felt rotten all the time , ' jameela says\n' i read up on this and discovered that not only does it take time for mercury levels to drop , but vapour can be released from the mercury when the fillings are removed and leak into the system\n' i think that the mercury was affecting my immune and digestive system\n' dentist dr atkins has spoken to many patients who have wanted to have their silver fillings removed because they 're concerned about the potential health issues\nbut he warns that removing amalgams can do more harm than good as more vapour can be inhaled into the system by doing this\n' aside from the fact there is no evidence to suggest amalgams are anything other than safe , every time a dentist drills a tooth , they remove a little dental tissue\nso you are essentially damaging the tooth , ' he says\nthe number of fillings in the average adult 's mouth still struggling , jameela saw a nutritionist who recommended drinking solutions made from clay and algae chlorella three times a day\nthese apparently bind to mercury and help remove it\nshe did this for two years , and tried various diets to tackle the ' inflammation ' linked to the mercury that was making her ill.
