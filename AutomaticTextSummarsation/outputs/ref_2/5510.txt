researchers studied 40 million posts made by 1.7 million web users
from this they divided people into two groups - future - banned users ( fbus ) and never - banned users ( nbus )
they built an algorithm that scans posts for signs of antisocial behaviour
study shows this algorithm can identify potential trolls in 80 % of cases
