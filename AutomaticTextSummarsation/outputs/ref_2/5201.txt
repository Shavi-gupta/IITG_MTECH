italian musician andrea was filmed playing in milton keynes
he holds a hand - made â butterfly landscape â designed didgeridoo
as he plays a tune some of the cows lift their heads and take note
suddenly the whole herd are compelled to run towards the sound
they stand rooted to the spot for the duration of the composition
andrea described moment as ' an amazing and humbling experience '
