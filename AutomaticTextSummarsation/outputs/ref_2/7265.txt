650 seats up for grabs on may 7 but more than half will not change hands because one party is so far ahead
electoral reform society calls result in 325 seats in @entity145 , 5 in scotland , 20 in @entity146 and 14 in @entity147
70 % of seats in the east of england are considered safe but only 10 % per cent in scotland as snp makes big gains
