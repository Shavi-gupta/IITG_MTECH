latest example of how nhs recruits overseas as it fails to train staff in britain
hospital managers have been hiring batches of 30 nurses on trips to spain
paramedics are being offered Â£ 4,500 â golden hellos â if they agree to move to britain within three months .
managers are so anxious to fill posts that 91 per cent of those who turned up to assessments were offered jobs .
applicants told the mail they had been promised a â new lifestyle â that would enable them to gain valuable experience , visit distant relatives and â shoot off â to spain for the weekend .
the few paramedics who did nât get jobs when managers first flew out in september were so keen they returned for the latest round of recruitment days â and vowed to turn up a third time if they still were nât hired .
managers claim they can save the nhs Â£ 9million by flying out to australia rather than training paramedics in britain .
