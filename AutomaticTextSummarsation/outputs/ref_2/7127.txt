retail experts say sales of royal memorabilia are unlikely to top Â£ 70m
by comparison , prince george 's birth resulted in a Â£ 247m splurge
between july and august 2013 , Â£ 70m was lavished on souvenirs alone
the newest royal is expected to have a big long term impact however
sales boost will be particularly noticeable if the new baby is a girl
