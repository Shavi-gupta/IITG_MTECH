tether unlimited has revealed a system of robo spiders than can construct solar panels , trusses and other parts of spacecraft in orbit
the system uses arachnid - like robots to construct large objects in orbit around the earth or further into the solar system
' the primary benefit of this on - orbit fabrication capability will be order - of - magnitude improvements in packing efficiency and system mass , which will enable nasa to use small , low - cost launch vehicles to deploy systems dramatically larger than possible with current state - of - the - art technologies
