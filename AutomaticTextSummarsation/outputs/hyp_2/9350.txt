the us supreme court 's arguments on tuesday over same - sex marriage will cap more than two decades of litigation and a transformation in public attitudes
based on the court 's actions during the past two years , a sense of inevitability is in the air : that a majority is on the verge of declaring gay marriage legal nationwide
how much will kennedy , a member of the court 's five - man conservative bloc who often casts decisive votes in close cases , show his hand in the 2 - 1/2 hours of oral arguments ? will he reveal a clear view that the constitution gives gay people a right to marry or will he voice concerns for state interests in controlling marriage laws ? an element of uncertainty hovers over chief justice roberts , who broke with the other court conservatives and cast the deciding vote upholding president barack obama 's healthcare law in 2012
