in terms of the needle , many images posted using this hashtag include tattoos and giving blood following yesterday 's update , instagram users can post , explore other people 's photos and interact with captions using emoji
emoji are popular in the instagram community , with nearly half of instagram captions ( pictured on rosie huntington-whiteley 's page ) already featuring the small pictures but she also noted that despite issuing an apparent blanket ban on searching for the aubergine emoji , searches for emojis such as the gun and a needle and syringe are allowed
