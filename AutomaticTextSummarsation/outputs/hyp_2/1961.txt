while scientists have long suspected the role played by eye - spots found on the wings of many butterflies were an example of mimicry , it has never been clearly tested but a new piece of research by biologists at jyv達造skyl達造 university in finland claims to have settled the debate
in some images they removed the owls eyes ( far left ) or removed the eye spots ( far right ) eye spots are a common feature on butterfly wings , like the bycyclus anyana butterfly above , but scientists have been divided over whether they were intended to mimic other predators or simply confuse predators ' predator - prey interactions in nature often involve dynamic encounters between the partners , and eye spots are more likely to appear suddenly in front of the predator
some entomologists claim the eyed hawk moth looks like the face of a fox or dog from the front the wing patterns of the eyed hawk moth is said to resemble the dark nose and the light coloured eyes of a fox
