jamestown is the capital of the south atlantic island of st helena , discovered by in 1502 by juan de nova it was a key stopping place for the ships of the east india company and other vessels - at its peak it serviced a thousand a year
framed by cragged volcanic cliffs soaring 800 metres ( 2,600 feet ) above sea level , the island is just 122 square kilometres in total the island , which is smaller than central paris has just 4,200 inhabitants - and 850 of them live in the small capital of jamestown early next year a Â£ 218m airport will open and make this british overseas territory no longer quite so isolated
as it stands , the only way to reach st helena is via ship - the rms st. helena , a royal mail ship that transports all supplies to the island traveller liz describes the ship as a ' ship of two halves ' : the front laden with dozens of huge containers , with a sundeck out back we are fortified in all this by the most enormous hearty meals : there âs even an extra savoury course after the cheese at dinner though i never get that far myself
