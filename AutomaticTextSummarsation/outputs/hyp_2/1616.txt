scientists have shown that using deep brain stimulation ( dbs ) , a technique already used to treat parkinson 's disease , can boost memory by causing new brain cells to be formed
deep brain stimulation is already used to treat parkinson 's , but now researchers now believe it could be used to improve brain function and ward off diseases such as dementia ( file image ) experiments on rats found the therapy improved their powers of recall , and it is hoped the same will apply to humans
tests on lab mice showed improved memory within just 24 hours , while the rodents ' life - spans were unaffected ( file image ) now the new research , published in the journal elife , has discovered it could also be used to enhance the growth of brain cells which relieves the harmful effects of dementia related conditions and improves short and long term memory
