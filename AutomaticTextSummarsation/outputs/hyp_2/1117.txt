maria malone - guerbaa , 41 , from london , used nothing but paints to turn herself into an uncanny painting of a grey rabbit with blue eyes , wearing a red bow tie
maria malone began her project by painting a white base layer to create the shape of the rabbit 's face and ears , adding the animal 's eyes ( below her own ) and nose and mouth ( over her own )
maria malone explained her inspiration for her rabbit scheme : ' my last couple of projects have been animal - themed so , with easter coming up , it had to be a rabbit this time around
