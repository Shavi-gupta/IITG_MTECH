all an illusion ? researchers claim that older buildings where hauntings ( illustrated by a stock image ) are usually reported , often have poor air quality from pollutants like toxic mould , which can affect our brains â experiences reported in many hauntings are similar to mental or neurological symptoms reported by individuals exposed to toxic moulds , â said professor shane rogers of clarkson university in potsdam , new york
â the real ghost busters : here , undergraduate environmental engineering students ( from left to right ) thomas o'rourke and daniel c. schwab work with professor shane rogers to sample air quality in buildings associated with alleged ghost activity the team have only just begun their investigations , but have been to a handful of â haunted â buildings to collect samples , as well as properties with mould , but no connection to ghosts
