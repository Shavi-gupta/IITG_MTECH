it is always revealing to see how players respond to adversity and root has reacted magnificently to being left out of last year âs sydney test
root showed plenty of grit , as well as talent , in yet another big innings for england root has bounced back from a difficult ashes tour to prove himself as a quality test batsman around four years ago i remember sitting next to thorpe on a bus journey and him quietly telling me that the young english batsman to watch out for was root
his fabulous form should be enough to see root left to do what he does best - score runs for england alastair cook ( right ) has shown the danger of making your best player the captain of the team i have enjoyed the battle between ben stokes and samuels in this test and i like the way the durham lad goes about his cricket
