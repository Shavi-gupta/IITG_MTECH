full back david raven stabbed home the winner to take inverness caledonian thistle to the scottish cup final
but what can we deduce about the state of scottish football from the two hampden semi-finals last weekend ? david raven peels away after scoring the winner for inverness caledonian thistle against celtic in the scottish cup semi-final raven celebrates with team - mate ryan christie as inverness caledonian thistle knocked celtic out at hampden well with scottish 's top club , celtic , taking the decision to embarrass themselves publicly by writing to the sfa crying about a penalty they were n't awarded against inverness caledonian thistle , you can see there are problems
josh meekings ( centre ) appeared to handle the ball in the box but no penalty was awarded to celtic kris commons appeals for a penalty after meeking 's apparent hand ball but it was to no avail celtic captain scott brown appeals to referee steve mclean - the club have since written to the sfa next the game north of the border must do more to attract supporters to matches
