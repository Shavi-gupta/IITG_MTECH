hundreds of passengers on a new york city subway train were evacuated from cars in an underwater tunnel after a fire during the monday morning commute
the train 's 542 passengers were taken by a rescue train to grand central station in manhattan , an mta spokesman told daily mail online
they walked through their stalled train into a rescue train and left around 10am part of the train 's contact shoe , which gets power from the third rail , is thought to have touched the board instead of the rail , sparking the incident that left service on the 7 train suspended for just less than two hours
