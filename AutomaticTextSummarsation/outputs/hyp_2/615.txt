traffic began to build up on the m58 around switch island in merseyside when a silver mercedes attempted to undertake the trafffic but a renault driver was n't happy and pulled into the inside lane to block the mercedes from moving forwards he attempted to sail up the inside lane in a sneaky bid to avoid having to wait
the two cars then swerve around the lane as the renault stays determined in not letting the mercedes past the mercedes , behind , is then forced to wait like the rest of the drivers , for 10 minutes as they approach an roundabout but each time he tries , the renault swerves in the lane blocking the mercedes from passing
eventually the mercedes driver catches up to the renault with the man shouting and pointing at the renault driver this then forces the mercedes to wait 10 minutes in the queue like everybody else before moving back into the correct lane as they approach a roundabout
