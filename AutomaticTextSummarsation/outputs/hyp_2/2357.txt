researchers have found that its shape is determined by two competing groups of proteins and by tweaking them , they can convert this lip into a standard petal
the orchid ( an example of which is pictured ) has evolved a so - called lip - a large and irregular modified petal , to attract insects - but the driving force behind this unusual shape was not known , until now the study , published in the journal nature plants , extends scientists ' understanding of the mechanisms leading to the diverse beauty of orchid flowers
they converted lips into petals in two orchid species by reducing the activity of the l complex using gene silencing ( illustrated ) conversion of lips into sepal / petal - like structures in oncidium and phalaenopsis orchids is shown orchids have three sepals , which sometimes look like other petals , and a single column at the centre
