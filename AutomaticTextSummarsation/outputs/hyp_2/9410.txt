sarkozy was being grilled by judges in a criminal court today two days after being heralded as the politician to save france from socialism
slinking back into public view : sarkozy is driven to court where he faces charges over the funding of his failed 2012 bid to retain the presidency of the country - two days after being heralded as france 's saviour thierry herzog , the lawyer of the former france president and current head of the right - wing ump opposition party , arrives at the pole financier headquarters ( the fraud section of the courthouse ) in paris not only was he roundly beaten by francois hollande , his detested socialist rival , but he is alleged to have got the ump party to pay off his personal fine approaching Â£ 500,000 for over-spending
' happier outing : on sunday , sarkozy 's party made massive electoral gains against the socialists in regional elections and he is convinced he can become president again in 2017 under pressure : france 's ruling socialists under francois hollande ( pictured ) suffered a crushing defeat in regional elections at the weekend - as three years of left - wing rule was branded a ' massive failure ' but his former lieutenant jean-franã§ois cope has already been charged in the funding case and sarkozy could suffer the same fate today
