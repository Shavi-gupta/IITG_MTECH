durham university scientists studied a ' clump ' of dark matter that appears to be lagging behind its galaxy - suggesting it interacts with itself
astronomers have found that the total mass / energy content of the universe is split in the proportions 68 per cent dark energy , 27 per cent dark matter and 5 per cent ' normal ' matter
this latest study follows research by the same team last month that found dark matter interacts with itself very little - but the fact that it interacts at all is very exciting , said dr massey
