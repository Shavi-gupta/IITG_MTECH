an airport luggage conveyor belt has a novel way of separating bags into the correct queues - but it 's a somewhat cut and thrust job
the red and black luggage moves along the conveyor after being taken from the plane suddenly the mechanical arm springs into action giving the luggage some brute force and with a sharp movement , the red and black case is passed down onto a lower conveyor belt the mechanism appears to work on a sensor system , ensuring it strikes out at the centre of the luggage so as to not spin it , but what might shock is the force of the action
this suitcase is set for a ride on a different conveyor in a matter of seconds the arm extends out to separate the luggage in the hope it arrives with its owner the video , after being uploaded to youtube , has been met with mixed responses
