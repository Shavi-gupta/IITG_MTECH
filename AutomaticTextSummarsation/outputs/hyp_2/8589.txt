organisms that lived in the sea 635 to 541 million years ago , from which humans and other animals evolved , likely had flexible appendages and a complex nervous system
today , humans and many other organisms are bilaterally symmetric ; we have a clearly discernible top and bottom , and a left and a right - such as depicted in da vinci 's the vitruvian man , shown left
