last weekend , after a sunny day in the borders , i posted this picture of myself on twitter with the caption â just met nicola sturgeon lookalike out canvassing ! â i admit , it was nât a particularly funny joke , but i had no idea of the outrage my light - hearted comment would provoke from the devoted followers of scotland âs first minister and the leader of the snp
janet street-porter said she had no idea of the outrage her ' light - hearted comment ' would provoke from nicola sturgeon 's ( pictured ) supporters so how has nicola sturgeon become teflon woman , a person so perfect that a mere joke about her appearance means ( according to her fans ) i can no longer be considered a feminist ? according to her followers , i am a traitor to my sex , a woman less attractive than red rum , a sub-human who should be neutered
does that make her any different to ed miliband , with his much - criticised relationships with the trade unions , or david cameron with his cronies in big business ? voters in england can do nothing to stop the nicola sturgeon bandwagon gaining momentum â snp membership has tripled in the past year , and it âs now the third - largest political party in the uk
