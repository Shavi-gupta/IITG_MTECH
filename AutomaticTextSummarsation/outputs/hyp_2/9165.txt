when rural farmer ashley stewart and his wife felicity found a baby male kangaroo on the side of the road in 2013 , they had no idea that the little joey would quickly become part of their family
two years on , the curious and friendly joey they have dubbed ' dusty ' is now so comfortable living with the couple and their dogs lilly and rosie on their farm , near esperance in western australia , that the stewart 's are convinced he actually thinks he is a dog too
dusty rides around the property in the back of mr stewart 's truck along with the dogs , sleeps with them on a dog bed , eats with them , asks for scratches , and even tries to sneak dog treats when he can
