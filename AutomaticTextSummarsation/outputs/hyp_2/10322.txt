curious passengers have burning questions every time they step foot on a plane â from whether pilots require a key to start a plane to where flight attendants sleep on long - haul flights
â flight attendants eat the same meals that are provided to passengers if the airline bothers to feed them at all is the crew served the same food as passengers ? if meals are provided by the airline , pilots do not eat the same reheated chicken or pasta dishes that are served to passengers in economy
â the airbus a350 has private sleeping quarters for flight attendants on long - haul flights where do pilots and cabin crew sleep and go to the loo ? planes that fly long - haul routes which require more than two pilots usually contain private bunks for the flight crew , said mr applegarth
