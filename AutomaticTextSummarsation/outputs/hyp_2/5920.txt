anti-bullying : turnham primary school - led by executive headteacher selina sharpe - sent out an agreement for all new children to sign before they start in the new academic year tick - box bureaucracy : but parents were dumbfounded when it included a demand not to use ' transphobic language ' , as it would mean explaining something many three - year - olds are not even aware exists it is understood that teachers at the south-east london school introduced the document to help stamp out playground prejudice against transgender people and a wide range of disabilities and cultures
â sorry : the school 's chair of governors has apologised for any offence or distress caused to parents or pupils turnham primary school is a foundation school , which means it is funded by the government through labour - run lewisham council , which yesterday refused to comment on the matter
