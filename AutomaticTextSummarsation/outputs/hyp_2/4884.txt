japan sky - gazers caught the moon when it was still white and out of the earth 's shadow it is the third of four consecutive lunar eclipses separated by six months - a tetrad - which is very rare atmospheric : the sky ( pictured in japan ) burned a deep red as the gleaming orange light shone through the clouds in new york , where the sun was rising , the sky glared orange from the reflection of the sun 's rays from the moon the full moon is seen over the santa monica mountains in topanga , california , shortly before it turns red during the lunar eclipse the moon is seen behind downtown high - rise buildings during the shortest total lunar eclipse of the century before dawn sky - gazers will have a better chance of catching the next full lunar eclipse on september 28 , that will last over an hour
