seaworld has been accused of drugging killer whales , painting over their injuries and keeping them in pools so shallow they get sunburned
a lawsuit filed by kuhl , a grandmother from south carolina who visited the orlando park in 2013 , claims orcas are being kept in 8ft deep holding pools , leaving the marine animals ' essentially roasting '
the backlash comes two years after the release of the documentary blackfish , which questioned the conditions orcas were kept in following killer whale tilikum 's fatal attack on trainer dawn brancheau at orlando in 2010
