a mother managed to raise Â£ 2,000 in just 24 hours to pay a special helmet for her son , who was born with flat - head syndrome
kate roberts , 24 , noticed her son miles had a slightly different shaped head when he was born , and at three months , he was diagnosed with brachycephaly , also known as ' flat head syndrome '
but mrs thomas went to a private clinic who warned miles could lose his sight due to the condition thanks to donations from friends and strangers , miles will be fitted with a custom - built helmet later this month , which he will have to wear for six months to change the shape of his head ' a man from newcastle that i do n't even know donated Â£ 500 and simply wrote " hope this helps " as his message on the site
