negotiations to make a fight between smith and ward are set to be concluded this week , with the liverpool super-middleweight set to meet one of boxing 's biggest talents on june 20
liverpool boxer smith ( left ) is in line to take on ward on june 20 ward ( right ) has won all of his 24 bouts but has not fought since defeating edwin rodriguez in november it is a huge opportunity for smith but an even bigger task against a fighter who outclassed froch in 2011
smith has lost his last two world title challenges to arthur abraham ( left ) of germany ward defeated froch in 2011 and could be set for a rematch if he beats smith smith 's hope this time round will be that ward , usually so slick and brilliantly accurate , has diminished through inactivity
