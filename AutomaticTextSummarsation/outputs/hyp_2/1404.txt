suddenly , after close to 14 years of international football and just 33 caps , michael carrick is the answer for england
michael carrick played against ecuador at the 2006 world cup but was dropped for the quarter - final england have won just four competitive matches when michael carrick started , including against poland michael carrick ( left ) played in the 2 - 0 defeat by croatia which went a long way to england missing out on euro 2008 under mcclaren he started in the disastrous double header of a 0 - 0 home draw with macedonia followed by a 2 - 0 defeat in croatia â the results that effectively cost england âs place at the 2008 european championship
michael carrick was hailed after an impressive performance for england in their friendly draw with italy last week michael carrick has also been impressive in manchester united 's midfield under louis van gaal this season so the idea that england managers are fools for consistently preferring steven gerrard and frank lampard is misguided
