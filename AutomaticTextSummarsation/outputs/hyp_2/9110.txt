with no cell phone reception to call for help , owner george had to leave his dog shelby stuck by the great salt lake 's spiral jetty and drive an hour out to the nearest town but the group was able to separate the dog from the tar , piece by piece , as they continued to put objects in to pit to keep shelby from getting stuck again or from continuing to sink lower into the pool of tar shelby still could n't move after he was freed from the pits , so five people helped carry him to the road and saw that george had come back just in time max mcgregor said that as they separated the dog from the tar piece by piece , they would continue putting objects in the pit to keep shelby from getting stuck again or continuing to sink
