a new method known as ' crispr ' - helping scientists make accurate changes to dna - was used by genetics professor george church , who replaced parts of elephant dna with the mammoth genes other researchers have proposed using mammoth dna to replace that of an elephant using a similar technique to the one used to clone dolly the sheep
researchers extracted dna from the remains of two woolly mammoths who died 36,000 years apart scientists have been able to extract dna from mammoth hair ( above ) and tusks found across siberia mammoths are thought to have evolved around 400,000 years ago in eastern asian and is a close relative to the asian elephant
the researchers studied mammoth remains found at oimyakon in siberia and wrangel island ( shown above ) this mammoth tusk on wrangel island in russia belonged to one of the last mammoths before they died out the new results suggest the animals were already in decline by the time humans began moving into europe 45,000 years ago
