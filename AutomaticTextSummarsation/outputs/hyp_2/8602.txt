a row between neighbours over a 40ft high leylandii hedge ( pictured ) has finally come to and end after 35 years the battle between the neighbouring properties started in 1980 when the owner planted a vegetable patch which withered and died in the shade of her neighbour 's massive hedge then , 23 years ago , single mother mrs audrey alexander bought the house and asked her neighbour robinson to trim the hedge
stirling council has finally ruled that the hedge can stay , despite claims it has knocked Â£ 20,000 off the value of neighbour audrey alexander 's house ( pictured ) the situation came to a head in 2008 , when a 65ft section of hedge is said to have fallen and demolished a neighbour 's garden shed audrey alexander ( pictured ) also claims other neighbours have had to move their children from their bedrooms at night for fear of the falling branches but her council has ruled that mrs robinson can keep the hedge , although it has to be cut to 20ft
ms audrey alexander called in council to try to solve the quarrel , but no solution could be found and the feud continued the council ruled that the hedge should be cut to about 20ft , a height which ms audrey alexander claims will still block most of her sunlight
