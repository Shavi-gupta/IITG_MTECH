a couple who spent a lifetime paying off their mortgage have said it was a waste of time after a council scheme to sell neighbouring homes for just Â£ 1 has turned the street into a ' ghetto '
linda and george hunter , who raised their four children in their home in garrick street , wavertree , liverpool , became mortgage free around 15 years ago
' she picked out houses worth around Â£ 120,000 and the council said they would look into it for her in october , but months later the couple were told the offer had fallen through as their street was now part of liverpool 's ' home for a pound ' scheme
