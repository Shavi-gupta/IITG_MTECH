luiz could be a doubt for psg 's champions league clash with barcelona after picking up a hamstring injury on sunday
luiz carries the ball out of defence on one of his trademark forays , but one such run led to his injury the brazilian defender immediately signalled to the bench that he would need to be replaced the former - chelsea defender attempted to continue breaking forward , but pulled up sharply holding his hamstring a couple of yards later
if it is serious as suggested then luiz will surely be a doubt for psg 's upcoming games with saint-etienne , bastia and barcelona , whom the french side face in the first leg of their champions league quarter - final on april 15
