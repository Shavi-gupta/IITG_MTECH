less than a week since it smashed its previous speeds , the so - called japan bullet train has entered the record books once more
the seven - car maglev - short for ' magnetic levitation ' - hit a top speed of 375mph ( 603 km / h ) and travelled for almost 11 seconds at speeds above 373mph ( 600km/h ) during a test run near mount fuji
the run beat last week 's speeds of 366mph ( 590kph ) , which in turn beat the train 's previous 12 - year record of 361mph ( 581km/h )
