these days we are increasingly using outdoor space for the occasional barbecue or to relax in a hot tub rather than for tending flowers , according to researchers ( file image ) almost 40 per cent of people , including 66 per cent of those aged 18 - 29 , spend more time sunbathing and having barbecues in their garden than tending it , according to the survey of 1,000 adults by the garden furniture retailer alfresia.co.uk
