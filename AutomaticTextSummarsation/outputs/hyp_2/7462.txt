about 4.45 billion years ago , 150 million years after the solar system formed , earth was hit by a mars - size object called theia
when corrected for meteoritic additions to earth and the moon after formation of the moon , the two bodies had identical tungsten isotopic compositions supporting evidence includes the earth 's spin and moon 's orbit having similar orientations
however , the other theory says that earth ( left ) and the moon ( right ) are so similar because the initial mars - sized object , theia , actually had a similar composition to earth
