rating : poets house is a swish new hotel in ely , a three - minute walk from the cathedral , offering terrific value
i keep thinking about phil neville , the former england footballer whose home once appeared in hello ! and which forever more is held as the gold standard for unadulterated bling
state of the art : poets house is as much a sex and the city retreat as a hideaway in genteel ely no , it might not be to all tastes ( there are mirrors everywhere with poetry written on them , such as lines from kipling : ' since my house to thy house no greater can send than thy house but my house , friend comforting friend ' ) and the floors are given over to black - and - white squares with embedded stars
