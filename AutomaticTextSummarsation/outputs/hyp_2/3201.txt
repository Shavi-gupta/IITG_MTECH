a newly - released video has highlighted the shocking - and arguably discriminatory - price differences between near - identical products and everyday services offered to women and men , the clip , which was created by hln 's daily share , illustrates the prevalence of this ' women 's tax ' to shocking affect by directly comparinga variety of different products and services aimed at men and women and then revealing the price differences
for example , a schick âs hydro 5 men âs razor was picked up for $ 8.56 , but the women 's version - the schick hydro silk - was , for some reason , given more than a one dollar mark - up , and was priced at $ 9.97
meanwhile , a pair of neutrogena anti-aging creams with the exact same ingredients were also found to inexplicably cost women $ 1.07 more per ounce - despite the skincare brand admitting that the two products were essentially the exact same product encased in different packaging
