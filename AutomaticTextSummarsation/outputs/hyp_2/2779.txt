after extensive chemical tests , dr shimron says he has linked the james ossuary â a 1st - century chalk box that some believe hold the bones of jesus ' brother â to the long disputed â jesus family tomb â in the city âs talpiot neighbourhood
dr shimron âs work has renewed the controversy over the talpiot tomb , which was found in 1980 and dates back to the second temple period and the time of jesus ( a portrait is pictured ) the long - disputed long disputed â jesus family tomb â in the city âs talpiot neighbourhood ( marked ) and is now sealed beneath a concrete slab after building work took place some years ago probing this connection , dr shimron and documentary maker jacobovici looked closer at the ossuaries , including the james ossuary , which is held by a private owner and bears the inscription , â james , son of joseph , brother of jesus â
now , dr shimron claims the chemical signature on the â crust â of the box matches that of a tomb in jerusalem known as the â jesus family tomb â where other ossuaries were found bearing the names of jesus and mary as well as â judah , son of jesus â
