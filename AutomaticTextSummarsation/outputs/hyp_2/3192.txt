international stars like mccullum will visit to play t20 cricket this summer , but talk among homegrown players is of how it might save england from further embarrassment in global competitions
' hales believes england 's players are n't competing in enough t20 competitions hales was at edgbaston on thursday at the launch of this season 's t20 domestic competition both he and woakes feel that a way of improving england 's one day cricket would be to adopt more the model of countries like australia and india with their franchise systems
england were thoroughly embarrassed at the 50 - over world cup earlier this year , dumped out of their group mccullum is adept at playing t20 all over the world and hales wants more of that for english stars ' it 's tougher here with the indifferent weather and i do n't really know what goes on behind the scenes , but in terms of standard and quality i think the franchise system would work in england
