in front of mr kyle and a tittering studio audience , a furious dawn then storms out , screeching : ' i 'm out of here ! ' the moment came towards the end of a stormy show in which the couple had hurled accusations at each other , with jamie admitting to having sex with one of dawn 's friends while she took their pet dog for a walk
but following dawn 's dramatic walkout , jamie , flanked by a furrow - browed mr kyle , insisted that it had all been a huge mistake
pleading : jamie then attempts to remonstrate with dawn and apologises for cheating bombshell : dawn then drops a bombshell of her own and admits to doing a spot of cheating herself
