they tested their theory using a 10 - hertz current on the brain 's of 20 volunteers to stimulate the brain 's natural alpha wave oscillations
researchers in north carolina claim that zapping the brain with a mild electric current can boost creativity by nearly eight per cent as well as creativity , these oscillations - or the lack of them - are linked with depression
enhancing these electric oscillations may help treat people with depression , scientists claim they tested their theory using a 10 - hertz current run through electrodes attached to the scalp on 20 volunteers to stimulate the brain 's natural alpha wave oscillations
