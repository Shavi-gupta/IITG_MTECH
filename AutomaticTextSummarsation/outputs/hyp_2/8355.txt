messenger is currently 18 miles ( 29.1km ) above mercury after nasa engineers used the last of its fuel in a last ditch effort to push the spacecraft higher into orbit after it dropped to within nine miles ( 15km ) of the surface
the above graphic was released by nasa to mark ten years since the spacecraft was launched in 2004 its journey included 15 trips around the sun before it entered orbit around mercury in 2011 - the first spacecraft to ever do so
' this image shows fine - grained volcanic material that has blown across impact craters almost like snow this colour image of mercury was one of the first sent back by messenger as it approached the planet in 2008 the above artist 's impression shows messenger as it orbits above the surface of mercury
