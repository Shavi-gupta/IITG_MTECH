the crew of the admiral kuznetsov , russian 's largest warship , came up with the novel idea to help keep the deck clear of debris which poses a major risk to jet planes taking off and landing
russian sailors on board the admiral kuznetsov , the country 's largest aircraft carrier , have come up with an inegnious way of cleaning the decks , by strapping an old mig - 15 engine to the front of a tractor debris on carrier decks can potentially get sucked into jet engines , so crew are usually required to do manual sweeps of the deck , but the crew of the admiral kuznetsov decided to do away with that bother even a single stray nut or bolt , if sucked into one of the fighter plane 's engines , could spell disaster for the pilot , and cause millions of dollars worth of damage
the ingenious crew members fitted the old mig engine with a diffuser , spreading the air out over the deck , and use the contraption like an enormous leaf blower , sending debris overboard the admiral kuznetsov has a deck spanning 14,700sqft , so rather than search the entire thing by hand , russian sailors built themselves a giant leaf - blowing machine instead bristling with anti-aircraft cannons , rocket batteries , gatling guns and underwater missiles , it weighs in at 43,000 tons and carries 1,690 crew
