ronaldo left the pitch with a supporter trying to hug him , bale left it knowing that once again the fingers of blame will be pointing at him after his first half miss after diego godin âs slip
with atletico âs left - back position still bearing a filipe luis - shaped hole , bale attacked at will and he looked for ronaldo with his crosses as the portuguese found himself in centre - forward territory regularly throughout the first 45 minutes
bale misses the best chance of the match early in the first half as jan oblak saves ronaldo is squeezed out by atletico midfielders mario suarez ( left ) and gabi when free - kicks came real âs way they were almost all taken by ronaldo , although bale was allowed to run over one â and in fairness to ronaldo all the set - pieces were awarded on ronaldo âs favoured left - side of the penalty area
