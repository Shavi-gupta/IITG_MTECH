scientists at a polish company that produce body armour systems are working to put a ' magic liquid ' that can harden on impact in their products
struszczyk said the liquid 's stopping capability , combined with the lower indentation of its surface , provides a higher safety level for the user compared with traditional , mostly kevlar - based , solutions
' the liquid has been used to create lightweight flexible sheets , which can be placed inside the body armour when hit by a high - speed projectile , a wide area of the stf hardens instantly , causing the usually massive energy to be dispersed away from the wearer 's internal organs
