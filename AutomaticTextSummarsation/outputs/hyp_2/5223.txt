politicians who begged scottish to stay in the union should not complain if the snp calls the shots at westminster after the election , sturgeon said last night
the snp leader used a bbc tv debate on thursday night to offer to â lock cameron out of downing street â â even if labour has fewer seats than the tory in a hung parliament
sturgeon dominated the so - called â challengers â debate â on thursday and her party is threatening to all but wipe out labour north of the border â it âs completely unacceptable now for those politicians to say , when scottish is perhaps going to make its view heard by voting snp , to say your voice ca nât be heard in the british
