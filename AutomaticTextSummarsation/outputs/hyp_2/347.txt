the obama administration stepped up its lobbying campaign on capitol hill today to try to persuade lawmakers not to pass any legislation that could hamper prospects for negotiating a final deal with iran to curb its nuclear program
administration officials as high up the rung as the president himself last week made calls to more than 130 federal lawmakers , urging them to support the deal secretary of state kerry negotiated with iran , and , at the very least , not to meddle in foreign affairs
the trio , along with secretary of state kerry and senior members of the intelligence community are this week lobbying members of congress and jewish community leaders to support the nuclear pact with iran opposition : senate foreign affairs chairman corker , pictured here last friday at the national rifle association 's annual conference , is whipping support for a bill that would give congress a say on a potential deal aimed at keeping tehran from developing a nuclear weapon
