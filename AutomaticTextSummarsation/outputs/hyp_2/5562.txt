captured in a front room in bahama , north carolina , the three dogs â a husky called sky , a brown and white springer spaniel called sadie and a black and white springer spaniel called marshall â take their positions on their make - shift stage
the video begins with sadie the springer spaniel barking and interacting with the husky named sky the springer spaniel then begins barking some more and suddenly the husky joins it , but instead produces a far more pleasant sounding howl
no , it 's like this ! the husky begins howling , causing the springer spaniel to stop barking and follow its lead all together now ! the three dogs point their noses to the sky and howl together in harmony before getting itself into position and producing a sound somewhere between a growl and a baritone howl , which adds a further dimension to the music being produced by the duo
