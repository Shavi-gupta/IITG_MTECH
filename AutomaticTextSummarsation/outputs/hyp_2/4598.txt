realtors in indy are looking to unload what 's likely the midwestern city 's gaudiest and most famous home -- a 26,000 - square - foot castle built of ranch homes glued together by a former pimp turned construction king
steadily grew : he cobbled them together , dug a swimming pool , dug ponds , imported fountains , added ballrooms , added life - size statues of gorillas , added -- of all things -- a stone grotto ( into which he installed a hot tub ) spacious : when the banks finally caught up with hostetler , who 'd long ago stopped paying his debts , his sprawling home had grown to 23,000 square feet the house is actually five garden - variety ranch houses cobbled together to form a 20,000 - plus square foot campus - o - fun complete with swimming pool , ballroom and guesthouse
gaudy : since hostetler 's death in 2006 , the house has remained empty , with some of its more outlandish accoutrements - such as a 6 - foot mermaid and polar bear statue - sold off the house is sometimes locally known as the ' pimp house ' or ' dolphin mansion '
