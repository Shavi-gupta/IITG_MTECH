british - born stall - holder tania rahman , 27 , was asked by salisbury city council if she wanted to run a stand at the celebration later this month
' discriminatory ' : tania rahman received a letter from salisbury city council telling her it would not accept her offer to run a food stall at a st george 's day event because it ' only wanted english food ' the council has now apologised after their response sparked a backlash from locals - who pointed out that chicken tikka masala is a british - made dish
how far does it go ? can only english people attend the event ? u-turn : the council has since apologised for the letter and reversed their decision by inviting ms tania rahman to run a stand on the day ' it is the utter ignorance of it all that makes me most upset
