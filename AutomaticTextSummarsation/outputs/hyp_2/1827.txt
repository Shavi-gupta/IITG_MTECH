scientists have used a new technique to reconstrcut the colourful patterns on 28 fossilised cone snail shells that are up to 6.6 million years old
the fossilised cone snail shells have bleached over time , like the one labelled a , but under ultraviolet light traces of pigment still in the shells are revealed , labelled b , allowing their colours to be reconstrcuted ( c ) instead of being a simple white colour , they were infact covered in streaks of orange , purple , blue and even large pokadots
the scientists now believe the cone snail shells , which come from the northern dominican republic , include 13 entirely new species
