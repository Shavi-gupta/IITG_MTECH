a mum has come under fire for sending out invitations to her son 's first birthday in which she lists very specific requests for the boy - including some rather large and pricy gifts
the unnamed woman , whose email was shared by a recipient yesterday on reddit , demands a $ 63.99 water table from walmart , a $ 19.99 play tent , a $ 14.99 play tunnel from ikea , and a $ 7.99 cheerios book , writing : ' if you are unable to get these items , please let us know so we can buy them right away for him
' the mother requests guests buy this play tunnel and this tent from ikea the only option that will do : the mom also very specifically requests this water table from walmart because of how the water drains the mother demands receipts for each gift so she can get the full value back if she returns them , and asks that the gifts do not have her son 's name on them , claiming that personalised goods attract kidnappers and she adds that her son does not need any more books than he already has
