as england âs supporters settled in for a few pints at the huntsman pub in the centre of turin on tuesday afternoon , a sizeable number spilled on to the street outside to sing the latest anti-ira song
england fans sang anti-ira songs during tuesday 's friendly draw with italy at the juventus stadium - there is no suggestion that the fans pictured in this image where involved in the chants michael carrick ( centre ) and the rest of the england squad applaud the travelling support in turin on tuesday frankly , it is embarrassing to listen to - a stain on our usually good - natured and good - humoured travelling supporters as we look ahead to june âs friendly with the republic of ireland in dublin
it seems by roy hodgson 's pained expression at the end of post-match briefings that the england boss would rather not be ansering questions about fans ' behaviour the first audible chants of this latest song can be traced back to celtic park in november , when england emerged with an uplifting 3 - 1 victory over scotland
