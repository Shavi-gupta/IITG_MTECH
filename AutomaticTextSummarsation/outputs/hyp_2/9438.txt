but ukip âs reputation for telling it straight was left in tatters this morning after the party âs deputy leader was caught posing for a photograph to make him look more educated â in front of a photoshopped library clutching a picture book
mr nuttall , ukip âs education spokesman , appeared in the party âs manifesto in thick - rimmed glasses holding a book called â british rebels and reformers â
the books behind mr nuttall were clearly photoshopped , appearing in mirror image next to each other the ukip deputy leader later took to twitter to joke about the allegations , insisting he just had ' two copies of every book ' but the attempt to present a more professional image risks being over-shadowed by falling poll ratings , rivals openly vying for the ukip leadership and chaos over the party 's flagship immigration policy
