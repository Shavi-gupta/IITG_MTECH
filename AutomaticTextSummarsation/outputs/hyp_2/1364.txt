martin springall , 38 , photographed his young daughter - who he wished not be named - standing near a rocky outcrop in zushi , japan , in july 2014
he said he was living and working in tokyo , around an hour north , and wanted to send a picture ' to my wife , who was at work '
martin springall ( pictured with his daughter , who he wished not to be named ) said he had ' no idea ' what the item could be a trick of the light or paranormal forces at play ? there is chatter online about what the cause of this apparent black boot apparition is eerie : a pair of black boots are clearly seen behind the little girl - even though her photographer father apparently does not recall a person standing there the reddit user who posted the controversial image online suggested they could be samurai boots - although others are not so sure mr martin springall gave permission for his friend , brian , to post the image to reddit - where it became a topic of ' mostly negative ' discussion - until it resurfaced this week ' i just kind of obsessed over that one photo for a couple of hours that evening and then tried to forget about it
