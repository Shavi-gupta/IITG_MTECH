the tiny village of jose ignacio is an understated getaway for the rich and famous , filed with pretty villas and sleek beach huts rolling stone ronnie wood ( left ) and colombian singer shakira ( right ) are among the stars said to have escaped the spotlight by holidaying in the chic resort of jose ignacio so , what has brought everyone from colombian singer shakira to rolling stone ronnie wood and restaurateur and playboy giuseppe cipriani - the man behind the glamorous giuseppe cipriani restaurants dotted around the world 's most stylish cities - to these shores ? wedged between oversized neighbours argentinian and brazilian , uruguay has largely stayed off the radar for european and us travellers , but has long been a favourite summer spot for south america thanks to its endless golden beaches and low prices
with an area of just 68,000 square miles , the country 's sizeable atlantic coastline is home to pretty villages , two major cities - the capital montevideo and the glorious colonial portuguese town of colonia - while the interior is dotted with little more than estancia farms breeding cattle and growing wine
colonia del sacramento is perhaps uruguay 's prettiest town , with cobbled streets and crumbling buildings left over from portuguese and spanish rule colonia del sacramento sits across the rio de la plata from argentinian ( buenos aires is just an hour away by ferry )
