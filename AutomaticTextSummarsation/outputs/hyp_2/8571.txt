us scientists have found a way to use discarded corn husks and stalks to make cheap hydrogen fuel that does n't pollute the environment like fossil fuels and it could accelerate the take up of biogas for cars eco-friendly hydrogen cars , which are already a reality , emit only water , but the gas is expensive and is not easy to store , meaning more research is needed for hydrogen cars to become mainstream
now , researchers at virginia polytechnic institute and state university have shown that it âs possible to convert 100 per cent of the sugar in corn stalks and husks â a by - product of farming â into hydrogen gas , which can be used to power vehicles
other hydrogen fuel production methods rely on highly processed sugars , but the virginia polytechnic institute and state university team used corn husks and stalks , ( a stock image of the whole plantis shown ) which are known as dirty biomass , to cut costs and make the fuel easier to produce locally â we believe this exciting technology has the potential to enable the widespread use of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles around the world and displace fossil fuels , â dr rollin said
