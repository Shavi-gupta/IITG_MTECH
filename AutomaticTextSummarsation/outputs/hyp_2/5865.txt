almond , 26 , from bristol , spent at least Â£ 40 a week buying new calvin klein boxers so that he could slip into a new ' crisp pair ' every day of the week
but after wiping out most of his savings , mr almond realised that it was ' bankruptcy or boxers ' - and that he needed to wean himself off his addiction
' crisp pair ' : during his year - long addiction , mr almond bought some 365 pairs of new boxers - and threw most pairs into the bin after just one wear whenever they stayed over , they would wear the same underwear for several days running , which he thought was ' disgusting '
