italian alex bellini is to be subjected to the full force of the iceberg as it melts , cracks and even flips - while hopefully staying safe inside his small spherical cabin
the capsule will be 10ft ( three metres ) wide and could fit 10 people - but mr alex bellini will remove all of the seats apart from one , for himself mr alex bellini , 36 , is seeking funding for his project , called adrift , which he hopes to begin in november 2016
mr alex bellini âs plan is to place his capsule on top of an iceberg and stay there but , if the iceberg were to flip , he could quite suddenly find his capsule thrown into the air the interior of the capsule may be placed on roller balls to alleviate some of the sudden movements if the iceberg flips , but mr alex bellini also plans to use sensors to detect tremors in the iceberg , suggesting it might be about to flip , so he can get himself into a safe bracing position and as it melts , it âs also possible the capsule could fall down a crack , or find itself encased under thousands of tons of ice
