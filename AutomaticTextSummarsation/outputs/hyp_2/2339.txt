fleming was asleep in the indiana apartment she shared with her boyfriend and newborn daughter when the doorbell rang on april 6
on the other side , police say , was a professionally dressed woman carrying a binder who introduced herself to fleming 's boyfriend as a dcs worker on a surprise visit
but authorities say the woman , geraldine r. jones , never worked for the child - welfare agency and that her visit to fleming 's apartment in anderson , about 30 miles north of indianapolis , was part of an elaborate scheme to take the 17 - day - old baby and claim the girl as her own
