there were 72 unprovoked shark attacks around the world last year , with three people killed in australia and south africa
however , despite the worrying statistics , only a minority of sharks are any danger to humans , with great white , bull and tiger sharks accounting for the vast majority of attacks
australia 's 11 attacks was lower than its 12.5 attacks per year average over the past ten years ( 2004 - 2013 ) and the two fatalities were in line with its 1.5 yearly average over the same time period
