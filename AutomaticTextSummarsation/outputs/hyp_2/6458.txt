pierce , pictured at the boston 5k with his late dog quinn , was one of only 10 percent of competitors to successfully complete the tough mudder 's ' king of the swingers ' obstacle in california last week pierce had to jump off a ledge and grab a piece of rope that he needed to swing to a bell 25 feet above the air , before falling into a pit of muddy water and although he was ' frustrated and angry ' at first , pierce was soon training himself to walk again
he has since climbed all 48 mountains in new hampshire , as well as run 30 road races , with his guide dog quinn pierce decided to run the 2015 boston marathon in honor of quinn after the dog passed away from bone cancer last year the challenge , just one of many in the team - oriented 10 - 12 mile obstacle course , required pierce to jump off a ledge and grab on to a rope , according to the tough mudder 's website
