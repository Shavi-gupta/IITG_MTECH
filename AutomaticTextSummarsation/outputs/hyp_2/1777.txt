now scientists have identified the unfortunate individual whose bones were found fused to the walls of a cave in lamalunga , near altamura , in southern italy
using analysis of dna extracted from the bones sticking out from the limestone rock , researchers have found he was a neanderthal who fell down a sinkhole around 150,000 years ago
' researchers have , up until now , held off from excavating the remains ( above ) as they believed it would cause irreparable damage to the skeleton but an early studies had suggested it had some neanderthal features the lamalunga cave where the uniquely preserved neanderthal skeleton was found is close to altamura , italy neanderthals are thought to have numbered up to 70,000 at their peak and lived in hunter gatherer societies the researchers now hope that further analysis of the dna might reveal new insights into neanderthal evolution
