they found that the cotton products absorb chemicals commonly used on toilet paper , laundry detergents and shampoos , which glow under uv light , meaning that they could shed light on previously undetectable misplumbed pathways
professor lerner , who led the study at the university of sheffield 's faculty of engineering , explained : â more than a million homes have their waste water incorrectly connected into the surface water network , which means their sewage is being discharged into a river , rather than going to a treatment plant
on the right , professor lerner tests for sewage pollution in a stream in sheffield , uk , using a conductivity and temperature meter - a more expensive but less effective method than using tampons and uv lighting tampons absorb chemicals commonly used on toilet paper , laundry detergents ( pictured with a stock image ) and shampoos , which glow under uv light , meaning that they could shed light on previously undetectable mis - plumbed pathways engineers have shown that tampons can glow in ultra-violet ( uv ) light , because they absorb chemicals found in products containing â optical brighteners â which are used to whiten and brighten colours
