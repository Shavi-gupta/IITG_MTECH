named hyperion , the moon 's porous surface can be seen in incredible detail in this image taken by cassini as it performed a flyby of the satellite
cassini was around 38,500 miles ( 62,000 km ) from hyperion when the image was taken hyperion is shaped like a potato and is one of the largest bodies in the solar system known to be so irregular
during the flyby , cassini got more than it bargained for as hyperion unleashed a burst of charged particles towards the spacecraft , effectively delivering a giant 200 - volt electric shock ( artist 's impression pictured )
