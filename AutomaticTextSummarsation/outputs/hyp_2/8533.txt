arsenal , who were knocked out by monaco this season , could drop down in the pots for the group stages chelsea look to be marching towards the premier league title so would stay in pot 1 if real madrid do n't win la liga or the champions league they will be in pot 2 next season if things stay as they are in europe ... champions league winner barcelona bayern munich chelsea juventus psg zenit st petersburg benfica real madrid would also drop down if barcelona wins the champions league and spanish league
porto are trailing benfica in primeira liga so would also miss out on pot 1 in the champions league psv would benefit if the winners of the champions league also won their domestic title
