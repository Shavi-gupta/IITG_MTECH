a thick layer of dust covers the glaciers , so they appear as the surface of the ground , but radar measurements show that there are glaciers composed of frozen water underneath the dust using radar measurements ( shown ) from nasa 's mars reconnaissance orbiter , researchers have been able to identify thousands of glacier - like formations on mars
they looked at how big the glaciers were , and also how similar they were to glaciers on earth ( one in alaska shown ) nasa âs mars reconnaissance orbiter , artist 's illustration shown , launched on 12 august 2005
