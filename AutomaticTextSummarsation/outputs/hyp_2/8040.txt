the sru have clinched the biggest shirt sponsorship deal in their history after agreeing a Â£ 3.6million contract over three years with bt
sportsmail exclusively revealed last year that bt had agreed to pay Â£ 20m over four years for the naming rights of murrayfield stadium â and that the telecommunications giant would follow that up with a deal to have their trademarks on the famous dark blue jersey
the scotland shirt , worn here by david denton , will have bt on it rather than rbs from the summer â i am delighted bt will be the new strip partner of the scotland teams and although i can not confirm how much the deal is worth as it is commercially sensitive , i can confirm it is the largest ever shirt sponsorship deal we have done , â said mckay , the sru âs director of commercial operations , communications and public affairs
