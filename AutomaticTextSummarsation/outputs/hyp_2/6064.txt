following sterling 's interview on wednesday , in which he said he was not ready to sign a new contract at liverpool , blogger david tyrer of live4liverpool gives the view from merseyside
obviously , with the caveat that we get our money âs worth ! sterling returns to liverpool training after the international break and shakes hands with manager rodgers sterling risked angering liverpool fans after he said in an interview he was not ready to sign a contract sterling trains ahead of the weekend 's game with arsenal it âs always disappointing when a young player gets his head turned , but there âs a sense of ungratefulness about the whole situation , considering how the club has nurtured him and paid him well throughout
sterling did not have his best game in a liverpool shirt during the defeat at manchester united liverpool fans have a mantra that no player is bigger than the club if sterling was to move to arsenal then it would not go down well with liverpool fans but if he does end up going , he âs worth a lot more than many established players
