ford , who was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer after his release last year , was too weak to stand when stroud walked into his louisiana home last week but shook his hand
ford was released from prison in angola last year face - to - face : the 65 - year - old , who was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer shortly after being freed from prison , shook the former prosecutor 's hand as he walked into his home ' i 'm sorry , ' ford added
struggle : ford told stroud that he could not forgive him for what he had done as a young lawyer pain : after stroud left , ford was overcome with emotion and was comforted by his carers , pictured ' the audacity of the state 's effort to deny mr. ford any compensation for the horrors he suffered in the name of louisiana justice is appalling
