a new campaign from rape crisis london has captured hundreds of women across london in various outfits to point out that no matter what they choose to wear they are not asking to be raped the initiative , created by rape crisis london , aims to stamp out any suggestion that a woman can be blamed for her attack because of her choice in clothing
a photographer captured 2,000 pictures of 200 women in london as part of the campaign the campaign aims to stamp out the myth that women are ' asking for it ' because of how they are dressed they say : ' there 's a myth that surrounds women , a myth that embroils them : women who dress or behave suggestively , women who are playful or who act provocatively , women who flirt or openly discuss sex â they 're ' asking for it '
' the photos are accompanied by the manifesto which states that no piece of clothing means ' yes ' the campaign asks women to join the movement by uploading their images to instagram using the hashtag in january this year the head of the crown prosecution service , alison saunders , said society must ' challenge ' the view that rape victims should be blamed if they had been ' drinking ' ' no one should be able to blame rape on a short skirt
