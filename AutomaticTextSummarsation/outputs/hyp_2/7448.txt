a clutch of sausages stuffed with poisons were found on the cuckoo trail , a path running from hampden park to heathfield near hailsham
the grim discovery comes after a spate of dog poisonings in nearby brighton and hove , and dog owners are now being warned by sussex police to be aware when they are out walking their animals
the sausages were loaded with the poison ( left ) and found hidden among the grass ( right ) on the trail ' thankfully i have a search dog that is able to indicate if something does n't smell right , but please watch any dog off the lead as they were not in eye sight but easily consumed and in multiple places along the trail
