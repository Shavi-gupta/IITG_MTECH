a seven - time scudetto winner with juventus , buffon has played with the likes of pirlo , paval nedved and lilian thuram
roberto baggio scored 27 goals in 56 appearances for italy and makes buffon 's all - time xi ronaldo ( brazilian ) the best i have ever played against , if it was nât for injury i think he would be talked about on same level as pele and diego maradona
