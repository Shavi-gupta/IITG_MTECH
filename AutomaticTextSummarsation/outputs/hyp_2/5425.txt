according to the andean air mail and peruvian times , the idea is to change the ' axis of the visitor experience ' making the mountain into a part of the tourist experience as well as the inca city itself , with the hopes that this can control crowd flow - the project is set to cost around Â£ 28.5million
an online document outlining the plan states : ' groups of 100 visitors will leave approximately every 10 minutes ( from the visitor âs centre ) toward any of the possible options , easing up the congestion on the heritage space with the aid of interpretive signs and a more efficient action by the guides
since 2011 , the number of average daily number of visitors has far exceeded the daily limit of 2,500 agreed to by peru and unesco in 2008 , unesco , the ministry of culture and the peru government agreed that no more than 2,500 people should visit the site per day
