but whelan demonstrated how little regard he had for an fa investigation into an exchange of racist , sexist , homophobic and anti-semitic messages between mackay and his former cardiff colleague , iain moody , by not only appointing him but then trying to justify the decision with some deeply offensive remarks of his own
this is how sportsmail 's chief sports reporter matt lawton revealed the investigation in august 2014 sportsmail led the way with the exclusive story about mackay and his cardiff colleague iain moody mackay was appointed manager of wigan in november 2014 but has arguably harmed the football club whelan 's appointment of mackay did little good for the club as they face relegation from the championship how the championship table currently shapes up but it might have become an awful lot more uncomfortable before it got better , irrespective of where wigan finish up in the championship
