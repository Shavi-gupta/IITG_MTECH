manchester united climbed above rivals manchester city on saturday night into third place in the premier league table after a 3 - 1 victory over aston villa
passing was excellent and his two goals were thoroughly deserved â 8.5 manchester united midfielder ander herrera celebrates opening the scoring against aston villa michael carrick â having a renaissance this season after disappearing under david moyes ; kept things simple and smooth â 7 fellaini â he bullied liverpool in his last performance but was nât so aggressive here ; could have scored with a second half header â 6.5 mata â no repeat of his anfield heroics
had previously found it hard work trying to contain ashley young â 5.5 jores okore â powerless to stop wayne rooney scoring a magnificent second ; not a great impact on the game â 5.5 aston villa defender jores okore ( left ) vies for the ball with manchester united captain wayne rooney ciaran clark â fortunate to escape in the fourth minute when wrestling wayne rooney to the floor ; could easily have been sent - off â 6 matthew lowton â playing out of position on the left and it was heavy weather at times when mata started running at him â 5.5 charles nâzogbia â seemed his job was more centred on stopping manchester united attacking rather than on going forward himself â 5.5 carlos sanchez â lots of energy in the middle but offered nothing to get aston villa going forward ; difficult afternoon â 6 fabian delph â had his work cut out trying to keep ander herrera in check
