dr al-atraqchi , 42 , faces being struck off the medical register making him unable to continue working at the custom house in newham , east london as well as other surgeries in london after he was found with the footage
dr al-atraqchi could be struck off after he admitted secretly filming men in the gym showers by cutting a hole in lynx shampoo bottles and concealing his iphone inside before he put bottles into cubicles but al-atraqchi was caught out twice - once when a man noticed a glint of a camera through a bottle , and again when a fitness instructor became suspicious when he heard plastic being rustled and saw a lynx bottle appear in his shower cubicle
in the first incident , in march last year , the iraqi gp was found out when a naked gym user noticed a shower gel bottle being moved under the exposed area at the bottom of the cubicle and spotted a man 's hand moving the bottle around as if to re-position it
