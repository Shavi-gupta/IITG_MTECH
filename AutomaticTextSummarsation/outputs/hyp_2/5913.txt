linear dunes , like these captured by nasa 's landsat 7 satellite , are straight ridges of sand that have been known to measure as long as 99 miles ( 160km )
this image shows ' ribbons ' of sand and patterned stripes in an area known as the erg chech , a desolate sand sea in southwestern algeria - but the exact cause of these longitudinal structures is not known the image was spotted by io9 and the colours were caused as rays of sunlight hit the sand and were reflected off
they are commonly seen in clouds , creating what 's known as ' cloud streets ' that appear as cumulus - type clouds align to be parallel to the wind ( illustrated right ) in his book , geomorphology of desert dunes , lancaster from the desert research institute argues that this theory has its flaws
