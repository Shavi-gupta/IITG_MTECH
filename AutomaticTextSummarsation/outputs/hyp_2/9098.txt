scott dann was a fraction offside when he set up glenn murray for crystal palace âs first goal , but it would be harsh to put too much blame on assistant john brooks
he was spot on with two equally tight calls in the same move â before scott dann got the ball ( 1 ) and for glenn murray âs finish ( 3 )
the speed of it , plus two players blocking his view , made it unbelievably hard for him to get all three right .
