davis would love to see jimmy white and reanne evans light up the crucible stage but admits his own swan song hopes look forlorn
reanne evans saw her task made all the more intimidating when she was drawn to face 1997 world champion ken doherty on thursday , in the first of three preliminary rounds , while jimmy white will tackle fellow veteran james wattana in his opener on saturday
davis will attempt to qualify for this year 's world championship at the crucible but davis , who will also attempt to qualify , expects both would relish the challenge if they fought their way through to the first round in sheffield
