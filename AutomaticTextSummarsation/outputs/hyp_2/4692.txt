the intriguing research says that a beam fired from the machine would create artificial auroras â and it could even create lightning in the atmosphere
auroras occur when highly charged electrons from the solar wind collide with atoms of oxygen and nitrogen in the earth 's atmosphere at altitudes from 20 to 200 miles ( 32 to 320km ) above the planet âs surface
â the paths of the electrons would trace out the arcing field lines of earth âs magnetic field , illustrating how they bend and snap during the intense geomagnetic activity caused by solar storms
