baby name showdown : nicholas and kseniya ca n't agree over whether to name their child spyridon or michael , which nicholas says his wife will shorten to mischa ' the argument is serious â it âs not a joke , ' kseniya , 33 , told the new york post
rich history : nicholas says the name spyridon ' has been held by the highest and most honored officials and patriots of both the u.s. and the former soviet union ' however , the nights of ' bickering about it back and forth ' may be moot : the couple does not even know for sure whether they are even having a son
mystery child : the couple does n't yet know the sex of their baby ; if it 's a girl , nicolas will surrender all naming rights to kseniya while they wait to find out , nicholas is hoping to get 100,000 signatures supporting his choice â the magic number that his wife agreed would be enough for him to get his way
