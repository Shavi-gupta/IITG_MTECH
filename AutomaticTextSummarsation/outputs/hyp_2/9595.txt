hatch and trent , who were married for more than three decades , were dubbed ' mr and mrs music ' after composing for artists including frank sinatra , dean martin , scott walker , shirley bassey and petula clark
but the mail on sunday can reveal that hatch was banned from the funeral by trent 's second husband , gregory , who today accuses the composer of breaking his wife 's heart
after years of pressure , says gregory , hatch agreed to acknowledge trent 's part and her name now appears against some of the songs on the hatch website
