nasa has spotted an exoplanet 13,000 light - years away , making it one of the most distant planets ever found
known as ' ogle-2014-blg-0124lb , ' the gas giant was detected by the spitzer space telescope and the ogle warsaw telescope in chile
the planet was dicovered via microlensing which happens when one star passes in front of another , and its gravity acts as a lens to magnify the more distant star 's light microlensing complements other planet - hunting tools , such as the kepler mission , which has found more than 1,000 planets closer to home
