a cheeky monkey was captured on camera snatching a banana from a female tourist before slapping her gopro when she got too close
filmed in the thai town of kanchanaburi , the monkey approaches the woman , who holds a banana , with its outstretched hands
up close and personal ! the curious monkey gets right up to the camera lens and gives it a sniff startled by the monkey âs reaction , its friend who sits next to it looks genuinely shocked and rather hilariously raises its eyebrows in surprise
