the bbc has apologised and admitted the fell victim to a hoaxer who appeared on the bbc world service claiming the star wars films are anti-women , anti-gay and said darth vader listens to rap music
however , despite the fact that mr godfrey elfwick 's twitter bio states that he is a ' demisexual genderqueen muslim atheist ' he was still invited on to the programme
mr godfrey elfwick said the film was anti-women turning his attentions to darth vader , pictured , he said : ' the main bad guy - what 's he called dark raider - is he black , he has a deep voice , he listens to rap music - it 's just a really bad racial stereotype ' ' the guest presented himself as a 20 - year - old who 's never seen star wars ; and we put him on air under that pretence
