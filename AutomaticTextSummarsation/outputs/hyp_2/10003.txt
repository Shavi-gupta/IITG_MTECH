as so - called short waves collide near the surface they create weak microseismic waves , which combine with long , more powerful waves dragging across the ocean 's floor to create the constant hum. it 's long been known that earthquakes contribute to making the earth ring like a bell , but researchers have now proved ocean waves also play a role
as short waves collide near the surface they create weak microseismic waves , which combine with long waves on the ocean 's floor to create a constant hum earthquakes shake the planet in such a way that the earth can oscillate for months after the seismic event
from this , the team could conclude the hum was caused by the storm , and not leftover from the seismic events using seismic readings from 2008 , a french team spotted that ocean waves colliding generate seismic activity , but these waves only take 13 seconds to complete a single oscillation
