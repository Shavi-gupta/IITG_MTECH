prague âs international airport has been forced to hire porters to carry passengers â luggage up 32 stairs because a multi-million pound construction project did nât budget for an escalator
a new metro line extension opened this week in the czech capital â transporting travellers closer to the airport than ever before â but the point where passengers transfer from trains to buses does nât have a moving staircase
â without a direct train connection , the no 119 bus takes passengers on the final five miles between prague airport and the nearest metro station
