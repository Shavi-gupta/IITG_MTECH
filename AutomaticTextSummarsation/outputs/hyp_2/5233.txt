the apple watch version one , with its much - hyped unbreakable sapphire screen and hundreds of apps , may not be all that it 's cracked up to be and has been labelled ' a waste of money ' by some of australia 's tech experts
with the wait almost over , release date for the whiz - bang time - piece is set down for april 24 , the price comparison website finder.com.au suggests , if you have n't already pre-ordered , you might be better off waiting until next year for the second generation apple watch
those who pre-ordered are expected to take delivery on friday while apple is promoting the release with ads stating " you âre going to be amazed by how many things you can do with apple watch " , a survey of five australia technology experts found a less than enthusiastic response to the current offerings available on the watch
