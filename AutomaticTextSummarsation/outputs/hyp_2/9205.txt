a bitter war of words has erupted between a young woman and a butcher in sydney 's eastern suburbs over exactly what happened when belinda bartholomew , the girlfriend of sydney roosters star aidan guerra , tried to buy a chicken to cook up for a game of thrones - inspired feast
ms belinda bartholomew claims the man working at sam the butcher in bondi swore at her and told her to leave , but the man working at the time said his customer was the one being rude the chicken ( pictured in front of aidan guerra ) was cooked by ms belinda bartholomew as part of a game of thrones - inspired feast ' another woman entered the shop at this point and she ordered sausages and paid in cash , and when she asked for a receipt he clearly ignored her on purpose so she actually lent over the counter and printed her own
ms belinda bartholomew ( left ) and the butcher both said she did n't end up paying for the chicken she and mr aidan guerra ( right ) later ate ms belinda bartholomew said she had decided to leave the shop without making a purchase but the butcher then thrust the chicken at her
