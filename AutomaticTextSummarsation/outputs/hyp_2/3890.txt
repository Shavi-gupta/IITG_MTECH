scientists analysed 57 species in the region and found that the majority of populations had diminished as a result of the nuclear accident
researchers have found that bird species are continuing to drop in fukushima ( shown after the disaster in 2011 )
â dr tim mousseau and his team made the findings using thermoluminescent detectors , which use gamma - radiation - sensitive crystals ( shown ) to measure radiation doses in individual subjects living in the wild one hard - hit species was the barn swallow ( stock image shown ) , hirundo rustica , which suffered large population losses due to radiation exposure the team are hoping to get information on what the future holds for fukushima from the chernobyl site , which was the scene of a devastating release of radioactive materials in ukraine in 1986
