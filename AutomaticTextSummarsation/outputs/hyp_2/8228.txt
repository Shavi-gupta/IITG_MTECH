this towering structure 130 miles from anchorage was once a two - story home , built after a forest fire swept the valley clean of trees
dr seuss fans flock to alaska to visit this 12 - cabin - high structure that looks like one of his illustrations teetering : the owner wanted to be able to see the idyllic valley over the tall trees around their cabin in need of renovation : it was abandoned for years but new owners are now renovating it eclectic : the storys are bound together with metal sticks and unusual platforms it seemed unfathomable to dr seuss fans that a real life version of this tower could be created however , when the trees eventually started shooting up again , the owner refused to relinquish his idyllic view of the mountains
stands out : the house is miles from any other home , about 130 miles from the center of anchorage ' we made it ! ' : these are just two of the hundreds of instagram posts taken by fans outside the property birds - eye view : alaska aerial media captured the unusual tower in all its glory after a heavy bout of snow and it has not gone unnoticed
