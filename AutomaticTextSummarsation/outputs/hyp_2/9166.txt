the men , pictured in southern china , release a cormorant bird , which then dives into the water and retrieves a carp , returning it to the fisherman 's reed raft
with just a bird , a gas lamp and a net , each morning , fishermen in china keep a special , thousand year old tradition alive the stunning images were captured on the river li in guilin , china , by a russia photographer called rogotneva
the images were all shot on the river li in guilin , china , which is in the southern part of the country heading out in the dawn 's light , each man is equipped only with a reed raft , a few trained cormorants and a small kerosene light source the elderly fishermen spend anywhere between two to three hours per day on the lake , despite the low yields from cormorant fishing on average , the men will only produce about 4kg of carp per day , but are still determined to keep this beautiful practice alive = this fishermen bring up the birds from when they are tiny chicks , so the cormorant is more of a pet than a hunter this way of fishing is ' absolutely ecologically safe , ' says rogotneva , who insists that the fishermen catch only as much as they need rogotneva said : ' these fishermen bring up their birds from when they are very small chicks , so you can almost call the cormorant a pet , like you would a dog
