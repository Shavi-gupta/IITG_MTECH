thailand 's aphibarnrat produced a brilliant finish to claim his second european tour title and break chinese hearts in the inaugural shenzhen international on sunday
teenager li hao-tong looked to have done enough to secure a hugely popular victory on home soil , the 19 - year - old emerging from a crowded leaderboard to card a closing 67 to finish 12 under par. that left overnight leader aphibarnrat two shots behind with two holes to play , only for the 25 - year - old to hole from 18 feet for an eagle on the 17th and then miss from 12 feet for what would have been a winning birdie on the last
the 25 - year - old was evidently emotional ( left ) , and congratulated by chinese teenager li hao-tong ( right ) another birdie on the 17th made li hao-tong odds - on favourite to become the first chinese winner of a european tour event on home soil , but the 19 - year - old could only watch on television as aphibarnrat conjured up a brilliant finish
