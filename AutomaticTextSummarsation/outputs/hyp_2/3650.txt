unlikely to face charges in california anytime soon : durst , 71 , pleaded not guilty thursday to two state gun charges in la in a case that would delay his extradition to la to face murder charges
durst was charged with berman 's murder last month a self - defense plea won acquittal in the death of black , but durst is charged in los angeles with murder in the death of longtime friend berman , 55 , who was shot in the head in 2000
durst 's lawyers say the arrest in new orleans was timed to coincide with the final episode of ' the jinx , ' which also described the disappearance of his wife , kathleen , in 1982 from new york ; the los angeles shooting of berman , 55 , in 2000 ; and black 's death in 2001 .
