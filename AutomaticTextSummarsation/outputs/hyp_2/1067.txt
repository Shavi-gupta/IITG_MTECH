while josh , 24 , slept , his mate rob , also 24 , inked the words ' if found face down call an ambulance ' on his back , using a diy kit
josh awoke after a party to find that his friend had tattooed his back josh ( centre ) was tattooed by his friend rob ( right ) who was taking revenge on his mate after josh had attempted to tattoo rob with an at - home kit and it went horribly wrong rob said he carried out the practical joke on josh , who had passed out at a new year 's eve party , in revenge for a tattoo josh did on rob 's leg two years ago - which had gone horribly wrong
so when he saw josh passed out at the party , rob - who is a father of three - said he ' could n't resist ' the opportunity to execute revenge - and spent 30 minutes etching his own design into his mate 's back
