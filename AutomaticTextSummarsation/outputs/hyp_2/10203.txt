embarrassing footage has emerged of a missile launch going spectacularly wrong in russian
lift off : the rocket just about launches with debris and a plume of smoke clearly visible next to the russian flag up and down : the s300 rocket barely manages to take off before it starts plummeting back down to earth it scarcely gets off the launchpad and is followed by a small plume of smoke , before it can be seen dropping out of the sky as shouts can be heard from those watching
the leaked footage will be of some embarrassment to vladimir putin who as grown the russian defence budget has grown by 33 per cent to Â£ 54billion over the past year
