winemakers have been accused of fighting new eu regulations on revealing the calorie count on their labels because it will reveal that a bottle of red has the same as six digestives
closing the loophole : the european parliament is set to vote on whether alcoholic beverages must include calorie counts on their labels under current eu regulations , producers of alcoholic drinks are not obliged to reveal the nutritional value of their products on the label
fighting back : winemakers say that introducing nutritional labelling would mean annual tests to extablish calories of each vintage , leading to a rise in production costs that would mainly hit smaller vineyards ms abad also said that as the nutritional value of a bottle of wine changes with age , the calories on the label would not be the same down the line
