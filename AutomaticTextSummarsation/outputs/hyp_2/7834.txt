arsenal legend merson has been forced into an embarrassing climbdown and admitted he was wrong to criticise the england call up for townsend
' townsend scores england 's equaliser in their 1 - 1 friendly draw with italy in turin on tuesday night townsend celebrates his strike with tottenham team - mates ryan mason ( left ) and kyle walker in his column for skysports.com , merson wrote : ' if townsend can get in then it opens it up for anybody
' how can you tell me that a manager goes and watches manchester united against tottenham , the winger gets taken off after 30 minutes , the winger from the other team absolutely rinses the full - back for england and ashley young does n't get in the squad ? ' townsend later tweeted to his 285,000 followers : ' not bad for a player that should be ' nowhere near the squad ' ay @ paulmerse ? ' and merson insisted on wednesday he was pleased to be proven wrong by the 23 - year - old
