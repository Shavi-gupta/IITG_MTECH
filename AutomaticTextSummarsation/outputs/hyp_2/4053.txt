the short film has been developed on an oculus rift - a virtual reality headset - by italy 's university of udine 's hci lab. it is hoped the simulation can make people aware of the correct processes to follow for a landing on water the video is based on an actual event when , on january 15 , 2009 , miracle on the hudson was forced into a landing on water
the start of the virtual reality programme starts casual enough as the passenger moves to their seat a large bang is heard on the simulation before the plane starts to rapidly descend once seated the film jolts into action when a loud bang is heard , and the plane rocks from side to side
speaking to mailonline travel , chittaro , head of the project , said : ' the ' emergency water landing vr ' demo we have just released for the oculus rift was developed in the last year , and is just one of a series of aviation safety education games we are developing for all possible technological platforms , not just the oculus rift
