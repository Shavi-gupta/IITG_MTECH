stefan johansen gratefully picked up two individual prizes at the annual celtic player of the year awards dinner on sunday night then looked forward to the team clinching the scottish premiership title
stefan johansen has been in terrific form for celtic this season and has impressed during his first campaign ronny deila 's side went eight points clear of dons at the top of the table with a 3 - 0 away win at dundee on sunday , courtesy of a leigh griffiths hat - trick
the hoops will win the league for the fourth successive season if they beat dundee at home on friday night and the dons fail to win against the tannadice side on saturday , which would cap a ' special ' campaign for stefan johansen
