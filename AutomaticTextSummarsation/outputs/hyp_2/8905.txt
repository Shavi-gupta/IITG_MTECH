plans for a ' rainbow ' zebra crossing to support gay rights could be abandoned amid fears it would cause hallucinations for dementia sufferers
the brightly coloured pedestrian crossing was due to be installed in totnes in devon - the first in europe - as a mark of the town 's pride for its gay community
experts have warned that painting the road different colours could have side - effects for people with alzheimer 's ' i am concerned that if this keeps going backwards and forwards we will not be the first place in europe to do this , we will be the 40th
