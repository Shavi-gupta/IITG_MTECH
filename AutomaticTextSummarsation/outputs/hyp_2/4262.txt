president obama threw off the gloves and took a direct punch at one of his possible successors , likely republican presidential candidate walker , in an interview airing this morning
responding to walker 's claims that he 'd ' absolutely ' cancel or ' disown ' a deal with iran on ' day one ' if elected to higher office , obama told npr morning edition host steve inskeep that such an approach ' would be foolish
the current administration has been more willing to weigh in , however , when a presumed republican candidate threatens to dismantle one of the president 's prized domestic or foreign policies , which , in the case of walker , was the nuclear arrangement with iran
