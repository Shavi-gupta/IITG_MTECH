david cameron will launch a multi-billion pound sale of lloyds shares if he wins the election â in what would be the largest privatisation bonanza since the mrs thatcher era
the prime minister will today pledge that if he is returned to downing street he will offer the public Â£ 4 billion of lloyds shares still held by the government after brown âs Â£ 20 billion panic bailout with taxpayers â money during the 2008 economic crisis
individuals will be allowed to buy up to Â£ 10,000 worth of lloyds banking group shares , which were worth 78.7p when the stock market closed on friday â comfortably above the 73.6p paid by mr brown âs government
