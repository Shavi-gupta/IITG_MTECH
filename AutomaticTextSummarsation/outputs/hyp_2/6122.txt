patients at wolfson children 's hospital are able to remotely play with animals at the jacksonville humane society shelter
the system uses high - definition cameras and interactive toys to let the children control three different cat toys at the shelter with the push of a button , and then watch on the tv as the animals react and play with them
the idaho firm behind the system has already installed its system in 10 animals shelters across the us , letting anyone play with cats via the system - and plans to sell a version for pet owners via kickstarter next month
