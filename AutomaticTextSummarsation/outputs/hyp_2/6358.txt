a bizarre new dinosaur with bat - like wings has been discovered by a farmer in china and is now helping to shed new light on the evolution of flight
palaeontologists in china say the impeccably preserved fossil belongs to a small dinosaur thought to have lived 160 million years ago
palaeontologists are referring to chilesaurus diegosuarezi ( illustrated ) as a ' platypus ' dinosaur because of its bizarre combination of features researchers say the dinosaur , which would have weighted just 13 ounces ( 380g ) and was 33cm ( 12 inches ) long with a wings that spanned 60cm ( 23 inches ) , may have been an early evolutionary experiment with flight
