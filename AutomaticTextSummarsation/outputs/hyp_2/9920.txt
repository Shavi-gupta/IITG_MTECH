four years after the 2011 revolution that saw gaddafi 's hold on libyans crumbled , the once feared bab al-aziziya , situated in the capital city of tripoli , resembles a wasteland
then : a mural of a smiling gaddafi was painted on the side of the bab al-aziziya palace , but was a symbol of fear and terror to libyans growing up gaddafi 's children enjoyed their own fairground within the palace in tripoli - yet millions of libyans people suffered under his reign now : the palace has lain in ruin for almost four years , after it was hastily bulldozed by rebels once they took control of it in 2011 nowadays , only shabby outbuildings are left on the palace grounds , covered in graffiti and revolutionary slogans , while holes leading to a network of underground tunnels that once ran under the stronghold can still be accessed the monument of a gold - coloured fist clenching a united states fighter plane was vandalised and sent off to misrata , a rebel bastion during the revolt which ousted and killed gaddafi
rebels posted for photos in a foreign dignitaries reception room at bab al-aziziya when they stormed the building in 2011 the rebels later bulldozed the palace - but the green flooring from gaddafi 's home is still visible in parts of the derelict site gaddafi had expanded the grounds by knocking down adjacent neighbourhoods
