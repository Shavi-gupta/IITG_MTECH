samantha says she thinks she 's ' fabulous ' i sprung out of bed this morning and examined myself in the full - length bedroom mirror , and i can honestly say that there âs never a day when i would rather be someone else
haters : samantha has received death threats for standing up and saying ' i 'm beautiful ' this confidence annoys the heck out of other women
critical : samantha claims dove 's campaign works because it exploits our need to act modestly my personal take on this experiment is devastatingly simple : we âd rather fit in and humiliate ourselves by claiming to be average than give our fellow ' fairer ' sex any more ammunition than we 've got already against each other
