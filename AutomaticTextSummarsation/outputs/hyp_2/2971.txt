france giants psg have been dealt a major blow with the news that luiz will miss the champions league clash with barcelona
the former chelsea man pulled up clutching his hamstring following a bursting run against andre-pier gignac in the first - half of sunday âs game against rivals marseille
luiz carries the ball out of defence on one of his trademark forays , but one such run led to his injury the brazilian defender immediately signalled to the bench that he would need to be replaced and those worries have since been confirmed as scans revealed the brazilian will be out of action for at least four weeks meaning he will miss both legs of the quarter - final tie with barcelona
