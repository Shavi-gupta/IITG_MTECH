planners in windsor have allowed two costa cafes less than 500 yards apart coffee addicts in windsor wo n't have to go far for a fix â after planners in the royal borough allowed two costa shops less than 500 yards apart
the latest costa will open on the site of the former dedworth road hsbc branch , the last bank in the area before it closed last year amid protests
