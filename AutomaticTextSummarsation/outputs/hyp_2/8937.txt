in monday 's pre-match press conference almost every question asked to madrid coach ancelotti made reference to the fact that in six madrid derbies this season madrid are yet to win a single game â losing four and drawing two as atletico have beaten them twice in the league and in the spanish super cup and the copa del rey
' madrid boss ancelotti says he is not obsessed with atletico ahead of tuesday 's clash madrid - based papers marca ( left ) and as are looking ahead to the champions league quarter - final first leg ramos ( centre ) scored an injury - time equaliser for madrid as they beat atletico 4 - 1 aet in the champions league final last season at benfica 's stadium of light in lisbon however , atletico are unbeaten in six madrid derbies this term and dumped real out of the copa del rey his reference to ramos ' injury - time goal against atletico in lisbon that levelled diego godin 's header and allowed real to run in riot in extra-time will have struck a chord with madrid supporters who in the build - up to the game have been busy reminding their rivals that while they may have won none of the last six meetings they did come out on top in the match that mattered more than any other
