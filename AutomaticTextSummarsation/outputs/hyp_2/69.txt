the researchers cut real skin samples and then attempted to rip them by pulling them apart ( shown above ) using x-ray beams they were able to directly observe the microscopic changes that take place in skin to help it resist tearing during their stomach churning experiments
the researchers found the collagen in the skin dermis changes from being a disordered tangle ( shown left ) to line up in straight parallel rows ( shown right ) when skin is damaged to provide strength and tear resistance dr marc meyers , a materials scientist at the university of california san diego who also took part in the research , said : ' straightening and stretching allow the uptake of strain without much stress increase , and sliding allows more energy dissipation during inelastic deformation
the graphic above shows what happens to a notch in skin when it is stretched ( left ) compared to bone ( right ) unlike bone and teeth , which are also made of collagen fibres but tear and crack when under stress , the collagen in the skin appears to change its structure when placed under stress
