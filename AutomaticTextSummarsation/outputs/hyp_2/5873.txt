we spent Â£ 400 on a 1940s loo - it took us four months to find one ! claire nugent , 43 , and nigel morter , 47 , have been married for 14 years
she says : when nigel morter and i met as students in 1993 we soon discovered we both absolutely loved the 1940s
they restored a 1940s airfield control tower in norfolk and now run it as a b&b in 2011 , our dreams came true when we bought a world war ii airfield control tower near wells-next-the-sea for Â£ 295,000
