no young person wants their parents following them on social media , and sanders discovered firsthand why it is such a bad idea this week
the talented wide receiver , who is a sophomore at southern methodist university , wrote on twitter ; ' got ta get the hood doughnuts almost every morning
if my doughnuts do n't come in a plain white box , i do n't want them ! ' then , seeing this tweet , dad sanders decided to have a little fun with his son , and give him a piece of his mind , writing back ; ' you 're a huxtable with a million $ trust fund stop the hood stuff ! lololol
