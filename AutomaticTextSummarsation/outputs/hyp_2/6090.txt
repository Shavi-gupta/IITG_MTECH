now scientists have found vast deep water gas hydrates in the arctic that are reservoirs for abiotic methane â a gas which is 20 times more effective in trapping heat than carbon dioxide
serpentinisation occurs when seawater reacts with hot mantle rocks exhumed along large faults within the seafloor the reservoirs are secure , and scientists do n't believe they will impact climate change
