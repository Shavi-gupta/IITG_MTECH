comcast is abandoning its bid to buy time warner cable for $ 45.2billion and create a mega-size tv and internet provider , it was reported today
the move comes after fcc decided that merger was n't in the public interest and threw up a regulatory roadblock following fierce opposition from net neutrality activists and content providers like disney and 21st century fox
comcast wanted time warner cable to bulk up on subscribers as it deals with old rivals dish , directv and verizon 's fios , as well as newer , cheaper online competitors like netflix
