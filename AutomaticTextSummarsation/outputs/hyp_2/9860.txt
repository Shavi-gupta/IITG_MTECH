rovers rejected a Â£ 12million bid from hull city for scotland international jordan rhodes at the start of the season â a decision that will be vindicated should the 17 - goal striker score the winner in wednesday night 's sixth - round replay and take his side to wembley
â blackburn boss gary bowyer has said jordan rhodes ( centre ) can become an ewood park hero jordan rhodes goes into the fa cup replay on the back of scoring in blackburn 's 3 - 0 win over leeds rovers were a laughing stock when they were last in the fa cup quarter - finals in 2013 and only 8,000 turned up at ewood park to see them lose to millwall , but gary bowyer said : â there will be an extra 20,000 people in the stadium compared to that game against millwall
