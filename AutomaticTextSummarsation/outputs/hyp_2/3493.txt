laura , 24 , was told her now husband , jack , 23 , had just weeks to live on saturday april 11 , having battled leukaemia since 2013
in 2013 , jack knew there was something wrong when he started to feel tired and achy all the time - a blood test confirmed he had acute lymphoblastic leukaemia at the time laura was due to give birth to lilly and needed to focus on her , but the pair kept in touch ' i surprised jack by wearing a traditional white wedding dress after i told him i was wearing a smart suit
' laura surprised jack by wearing a traditional white wedding dress after telling him she would wear a suit there is nothing more jack wanted than to become laura 's husband , so she 's delighted to have been able to fulfil that wish for him ' i was devastated when i realised he had blood cancer , he had kept it to himself as he did n't want me to worry
