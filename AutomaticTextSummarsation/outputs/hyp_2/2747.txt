in 1982 , hollywood - born chanteuse charlene had a surprise worldwide hit with i 've never been to me
the view of the blue waters of lourdas , kefalonia , a stunning greek island untainted by the masses i often wonder why greek does n't sort out its economic problems by selling off some prime mediterranean real estate - how many uninhabited islands does one country really need ? out of the six biggest greek islands , even americans will recognise two : crete - the biggest - and rhodes ( fourth biggest )
it took probably the two worst events in the island 's history - the brutal massacre of italian troops in 1943 and the awful earthquake of 1953 - and used them as grist to the story 's romantic mill. kefalonia is perhaps best known as the setting for louis de berniã¨res 's novel captain corelli 's mandolin the 2001 film adaptation starred nicholas cage and penelope cruz but focussed on negative events kefalonia , however , is simply stunning - an absolute gem
