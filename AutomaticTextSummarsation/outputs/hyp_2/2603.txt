nearly 15 years ago an amazing story emerged of how a young japanese woman had travelled half - way across the world to try and find a suitcase stuffed with $ 1m dollars that had been buried in the snow
it was claimed that takako had believed the film fargo , fargo was real - after all the hit movie begins with the words ' this is a true story - when she was found dead in a mini-skirt and high - heeled boots in the frozen wastes of minnesota just days after arriving
peter berczeller used an actress to play takako in his 2003 film this is a true story , which told the real tale mimi ohmori in berczeller 's film ( left ) and rinko kikuchi in the zellner brothers ' new release ( right ) in the new film takako sets out with a crudely drawn treasure map across the frozen tundra of minnesota in search of her mythical fortune a still from this is a true story in which takako 's body is depicted exactly as it was found , right down to the black thigh boots , miniskirt and coat which she was wearing despite the freezing temperatures ' it was a half joke , half trick
