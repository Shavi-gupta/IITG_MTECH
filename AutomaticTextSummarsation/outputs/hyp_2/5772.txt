kyle said the tree was about 65ft long so he cut it to make it even on both sides and the seesaw was born as seen in the video , the seesaw is made from entirely raw materials â a large trunk sits securely in between the natural split of a tree
kyle climbed the tree with a sledge hammer and pounded the trunk into the split branches to stop it from sliding there is no seat attached to the trunk but handrails have been added for support and ropes help people get on â the whole thing kind of just happened
kyle said that the seesaw is a lot of fun and that it takes the childhood memory of playing on one and magnifies it by a thousand kyle 's woodwork has been featured in the providence art show , boston âs world trade center furniture show and the del mar woodworking competition in california a number of people have commented positively on the video with one youtube user writing : â that and a beer looks like a good time
