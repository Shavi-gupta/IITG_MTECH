the 1954 bentley r-type continental fastback was estimated to sell for around Â£ 200,000 by auctioneers but ended up being sold for Â£ 739,212 - a record for the auction house
the 1954 bentley r-type continental fastback ( pictured ) sold for almost four times its estimated value the rare bentley needs a full restoration after it was allowed to gather dust in a barn over the past 15 years more than 45 people placing bids on behalf of bidders from around the world in the room , over the phone and on the internet
but when it is ready , it could be worth more than Â£ 1million - and would prove itself a wise investment for the anonymous british collector who bought it earlier this week , a clapped out 1962 aston martin db4 series iii went on the market - offering car fanatics the chance to restore the virtually untouched vehicle - with the promise of being worth three times its Â£ 220,000 price tag when finished
