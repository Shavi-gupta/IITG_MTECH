walmart is coming under fire following a recent incident in tuscon , arizona where a thief was able to shoot of rounds from a weapon after stealing it from their store
mario valencia took a rifle from the super store on february 19 and was able to start firing it as soon as he left , something that should have been impossible due to the gun locks that are required on all weapons
when the gun was later recovered , after valencia was taken down by officer rapiejko , it was discovered the wire was loose , and only wrapped through the gun 's barrel and lock just once , not twice as is standard , allowing the weapon to be used as soon as it was taken
