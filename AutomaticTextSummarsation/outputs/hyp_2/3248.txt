under ground breaking reforms , social services minister scott morrison will reportedly scrap a provision that allows parents who do n't vaccinate their children to claim welfare benefits , including $ 726 from family tax benefit a , $ 7,500 - a - year from childcare rebate and $ 200 - a - week from the childcare benefit scheme
the way the system works now , children must be immunised to access childcare payments , however , a ' contentious loop hole ' means parents can avoid loosing their benefits by simply signing a form that says they object to immunisation based on ' personal , philosophical or religious ' reasons
currently around 39,000 australian children under the age of seven are not vaccinated putting them at risk of catching severe diseases labor leader bill shorten 's support will be vital to get the changes through the senate however he has already indicated there will be bipartisan support for the harsh provisions
