a manhattan judge has delivered a blistering sentencing speech to a banana mogul who ignored a woman 's seizures after feeding her cocaine at an all - night three - way sex romp and then tried to cover up her death , while putting the ' selfish ' and ' self - pitying ' millionaire away for 12 and a half years
self - absorbed : hoey , 43 ( left ) was sentenced to 12.5 years prison wednesday after refusing to help , calo , 41 , who died from a lethal mix of cocaine and alcohol , during a sex party at midtown hotel the kitano in january 2009 hoey , who finally plead guilty to the charges in august after long denying them , stopped the other woman in the hotel room , nicole zobkiw , from 911 , and also prevented hotel security coming into the room as calo - a mother of two - foamed at the mouth , bled from the nose , turned blue and died
she was later found guilty of lying to a grand jury luxurious : the millionaire banana mogul received over 12 years prison for conspiracy to distribute cocaine , conspiracy to suborn perjury and obstruction of justice relating to the incident at manhattan 's ritzy kitano hotel ( pictured ) hoey 's guilty pleas last year were the culmination of years of speculation and accusations regarding the importer 's hard - partying and callous ways
