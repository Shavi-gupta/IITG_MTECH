bumping into peter in mothercare in palma just over a year ago was not such a big surprise , since we both have houses in majorcan where i now live most of the year
donald trelford ( left ) had his son ben ( back right ) when he was 73 and his daughter poppy ( held by donald trelford ) when he was 76 - years - old since then claire , 52 , and i have had a second child , poppy , while it has just been announced that 74 - year - old peter and bella are expecting a sibling for their 20 - month - old daughter
donald trelford ( pictured with ben ) says the physical effort of coping with young children at his age can be demanding but he takes daily walks and uses an exercise bike to keep fit ben and i managed to edge our way to the loo without making eye contact with other passengers and thankfully things were soon put right
