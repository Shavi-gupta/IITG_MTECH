the televised debate between democratic candidates running for mayor of philadelphia came to a crashing halt on tuesday , when 74 - year - old lynne abraham collapsed on stage
it was only 10 minutes into the hour - long debate when abraham was heard falling as senator anthony williams answered a question , and the camera panned over to see the former philadelphia district attorney lying helpless on the floor
from left to right : abraham , nelson diaz , jim kenney , doug oliver , milton street and senator anthony williams that 's likely good news to her campaign managers , since abraham has been having a hard time raising enough money to compete with front - runners anthony williams and jim kenney , according to philly.com
