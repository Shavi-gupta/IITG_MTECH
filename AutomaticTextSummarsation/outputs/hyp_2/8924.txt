seitz , 37 , of ridgefield , received two years of conditional release , a sentence similar to probation , at the hearing in danbury superior court after his lawyer read aloud a letter written by his wife asking the judge for leniency on his behalf
authorities say seitz forgot to take his 15 - month - old son , benjamin , to day care on the morning of july 7 , 2014 , and left him in the car for seven hours while he went to work
co-workers at owl computer technologies said seitz spent the day working as usual , even making a trip in the car to a sandwich shop , not realizing benjamin was still buckled up in the backseat , according to the arrest warrant
