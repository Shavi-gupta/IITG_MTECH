charles kingham , 86 , and partner moore , 68 , have been together for 40 years and bought their home in the quiet lincolnshire seaside resort of mablethorpe for Â£ 35,000 in 1987
' ms moore claimed the problems started when people started selling drugs nearby and would walk up their garden path ' high '
at least they have each other : the couple have been together for 40 years despite ' misery ' caused by thugs every single window of their home has been smashed and the couple eventually got so sick of having to spend time and money replacing them that they took drastic measures
