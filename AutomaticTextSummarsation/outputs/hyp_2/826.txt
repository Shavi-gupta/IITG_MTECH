the results could help farmers on earth get a higher crop yield - and may also help future astronauts grow plants on missions beyond earth orbit to the moon and mars
nasa astronaut karen nyberg is pictured harvesting plants from a previous japan aerospace exploration agency ( japan aerospace exploration agency ) investigation of thale cress during expedition 37 in 2013 the experiment is being run by researchers at the japan aerospace exploration agency ( japan aerospace exploration agency )
the results could help farmers on earth get a higher crop yield - and may also help future astronauts grow plants on missions beyond earth orbit to the moon and mars ( illustration shown ) in particular , scientists think particles in plant cells that store and process starch for energy - amyloplast - may form in the direction of gravitational pull
