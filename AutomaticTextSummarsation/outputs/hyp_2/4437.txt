' this octopus is n't real is it ? where 's its head ? is its head in the sea ? did the man hack it [ off ] ? ' the youngster says while grimacing at his dinner plate
look of horror : luiz antonio 's mother reassures him that she only cooked using the octopuses ' little legs chopped ' comical scene : his mother is reduced to tears through laughter as she listens to the case in hand getting his way : after more than two minutes of discussion , luiz antonio is told he does n't have to eat the octopus and he can just stick to the potato and rice instead ' those animals are for us to take care , not eat them
