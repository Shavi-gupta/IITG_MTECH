over the years i âve been lucky enough to play with a lot of accomplished women golfers , including two former world no 1 's in lorena ochoa and laura davies
the sun was shining , ailsa craig was shimmering in the distance and hull put on a shot - making clinic
charley hull can make it to the very top of the women 's game if she carries on her progression teenager hull possesses the same â wow â factor as world no 1 rory mcilroy ( below ) one of the nice things for me about playing golf with the women pros is we usually hit the ball about the same length
