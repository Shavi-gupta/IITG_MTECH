a red hot djokovic is being tipped to end nadal 's stranglehold at roland garos in june but the spaniard dismissed the threat as being no different to those he has faced before
he comfortably beat nadal on his beloved red clay in last week 's monte carlo semi-finals , and the nature of djokovic 's 6 - 3 6 - 3 mauling means plenty are backing him to complete his collection of grand slam titles this year by winning his first roland garos
nadal practices in barcelona as he steps up his clay - court preparation ahead of the roland garos nadal was beaten convincingly by djokovic in monet carlo last week but as far as nadal is concerned , 2015 is no different to 2013 , 2012 or even 2011
