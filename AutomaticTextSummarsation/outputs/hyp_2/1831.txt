a pennsylvania high school is attracting national media attention for all the wrong reasons after a group of students organized a so - called anti-gay day protest , with future events scheduled
the organizers of the homophobic protest at mcguffey high school in washington county encouraged anyone who shared their bigoted stance to show support by wearing a flannel shirt to school and writing ' anti-gay ' on their hands
the event was held last thursday and students report that openly gay pupils also had bible verses pined to their lockers and were physically bullied by the so - called protesters
