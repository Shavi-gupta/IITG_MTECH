for days on end , two of its members slaved away baking enough cakes to feed 5,000 women attending the women 's institute âs centenary celebrations at the royal albert hall in june
â the royal albert hall declined to confirm the amount of the extra cake charge - but under the hall âs booking conditions , extra fees are liable if products of commercial sponsors are promoted inside the building baking the 44 women 's institute fruitcakes used more than five stone of butter , several hundred eggs and enough rum to paralyse a fleet of pirate ships
