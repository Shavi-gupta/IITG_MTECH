lambert has scarcely been given a chance since joining liverpool despite their striking problems brendan rodgers ' decision to ignore lambert , in favour of balotelli , is completely illogical this time last year lambert was about to play at a world cup for england but his stock has fallen since for brendan rodgers to ignore him when they have desperately needed goals is illogical
lambert has enjoyed the opportunity to score for his boyhood team but he deserves more football when he has started in the premier league or champions league , lambert and liverpool have impressed on his first premier league start for liverpool he scored , and when he played 90 minutes in four consecutive games he scored in the first game , liverpool won the next two , and drew the fourth
balotelli , no matter which way you look at it , has been useless , and lambert should be picked ahead of him balotelli was given more time on the pitch than lambert in liverpool 's fa cup semi-final defeat by aston villa lambert scored 20 goals for southampton - he may not be world class , but he is better than the alternatives lambert should have joined aston villa in january
