hillary âs now - famous scooby doo van made an appearance in council bluffs , iowa on thursday for a closed - door meeting with state democratic party officials â and it idled in a handicapped parking space from beginning to end
footage broadcast by ketv - 7 in the nearby city of omaha , nebraska , showed the presidential nominee emerging from a cafe , greeting onlookers and walking past the blue handicapped - parking sign to climb into the vehicle
secret service agents are technically federal law enforcement officers , so there was no chance of a parking ticket , even if scooby had been left unattended
