benitez famously guided liverpool to the champions league in 2005 as he enjoyed cup successes benitez remains popular at anfield , but when he left there were few regrets over his departure donovan chandler is a liverpool fan writer on 90min.com at anfield , we will be eternally grateful for the champions league trophy he delivered in 2005 , in spite of possessing what was , on paper at least , our worst accumulation of players in recent history
benitez won the fa cup with liverpool in 2006 on penalties against west ham with fernando torres and steven gerrard playing well together , benitez got close to the title , but never won it and for all his moments , i fully believe we are on the right track again under brendan rodgers , even if we ca n't quite clutch that final champions league spot this season - or miss out on the fa cup
liverpool 's failure in the premier league means that benitez will always be remembered as a cup specialist as far as my uneducated eyes can see , someone like west ham would be the best place for your money , if you 're that way inclined
