crystal palace âs xi on monday night may only have been worth a mere Â£ 17m , but left back martin kelly still made it through a manchester city defence deemed good enough to keep Â£ 40m signing eliaquim mangala on the bench to tee up a chance for wilfried zaha just 60 seconds into the game
eliaquim mangala ( green bib ) prepares to come on but he never made it off the manchester city bench however , striker glenn murray succeeded in putting another dent in manchester city âs chances of redeeming themselves after a run of four losses away , when he scored crystal palace âs first goal
glenn murray ( left ) cost crystal palace nothing four years ago yet found a way past the manchester city defence another expensive manchester city player , Â£ 24m - man toure , got his team back in the game with 12 minutes left , but they could nât penetrate crystal palace âs defence to find an equaliser and a 2 - 1 defeat leaves them nine points adrift of the top
