a huge murray river cod was removed from a perth wetland in novemeber last year : ' a lot of these fish are much larger than the native fish , so they prey on them and compete for habitat , ' dr morgan , the director of the centre for fish and fisheries research at murdoch university , said pest carps : ' in the south - west of western australia 90 per cent of the fish and 100 per cent of the crayfish are only found there , ' he added ' we 've now found it in three rivers around perth and south of perth
' research conducted by dr morgan and stephen beatty found that at least 13 species of fish had been introduced into south - western western australia , with pet owners believed to be the biggest culprits
' goldfish in captivity generally remain orange , grow to about 10 - 15 cm and weigh less than 100g â in the wild in western australia they get to 2kg and 40cm , ' dr morgan said pet owners who have dumped their aquarium fish in rivers are the culprits behind the invasion in 2012 , the world 's biggest ever specimen of a south american cichlid ( pictured ) was found living in western australia ' effectively people are unknowingly doing it - or occasionally they deliberately do it for fish to catch - but they 're basically released by pet owners , so people are n't really aware what damage they 're going to have in the ecosystem , ' dr morgan said
