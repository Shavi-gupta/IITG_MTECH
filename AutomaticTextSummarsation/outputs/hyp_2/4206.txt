judge whitaker said dea and darren 's kitchen ' did n't have their usual the flare , confidence or pizzazz ' sufficient lighting : as the buyer âs advocate jury discussed when viewing josh and charlotte âs kitchen , it âs not an area of the home that you can get away with the â bare bones â when it comes to lighting
try and find a good medium between something that looks great but is also low maintenance and easy to clean ! the judges were shocked that josh and charlotte 's had overlooked lighting over the bench top given charlotte 's food styling background ventilation : akin to the bathroom , the kitchen requires great ventilation so ensure you have a good quality range hood and windows that can be opened
