chip shop boss john clarkson has created a new answer to the creme question of ' how do you eat yours ? ' - by turning the chocolate into a pie to serve with chips
' everyone has heard of battered mars bars by now so i thought , " what would be the next step up ? " mr john clarkson rolls out the pie casing ( left ) before stuffing one and a half creme eggs into it ( right ) the pie is then covered with a lid and dipped in batter ( left ) before being quickly deep fried ( right ) ' creme eggs are just the right size and shape to be placed in a pie , so i thought ' why not ? ' ' it 's a laugh and i always like seeing what i can conjure up next for customers that might be seen as a bit strange or unusual
mr john clarkson says his savoury - sweet mix is a hit with customers , who have taken to dipping chips into the creme egg yolk , much like traditional toast soldiers and while this particularly sweet - savoury offering may seem odd to some , mr john clarkson is n't the first to have added his own touch to creme eggs
