holy smokes ! researchers found the bombardier beetle mimics a machine gun by mixing chemicals in an internal ' reaction chamber ' a beetle with a machine gun built into its rear end sounds like something from a comic or sci - fi film - or the stuff of nightmares
but researchers have discovered the bombardier beetle mimics this powerful weapon by mixing chemicals in an internal ' reaction chamber ' in its stomach
a real hot shot ! the research , including video footage ( shown above ) not only reveals the beetle 's firing apparatus in never - before - seen detail , but also solves a long - standing mystery of how the bugs achieve their rapid - fire capabilities the mechanism of the bombardier beetle 's spray pulsation had not been understood because previous studies , relying on external observations , could not probe exactly what happens inside the reaction chamber of the chemical gun
