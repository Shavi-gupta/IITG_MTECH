student hollinshead , 21 , stopped in the first space available when he saw the pensioner collapse on the pavement
but as he helped her for less than a minute , a traffic warden put a Â£ 70 ticket on his car â because mr hollinshead had pulled into a bay for disabled drivers
' it 's ridiculous ' : when he was slapped with the ticket on his windscreen mr hollinshead initially tore it up and threw it in the bin before later going back to pick it up yesterday mr hollinshead said the way he had been treated was ridiculous and said the council warden could see what was happening
