now researchers in the us and italy say they have evidence that dna - like fragments may have come with ' instructions ' that guided their growth into complex life forms 4 billion years ago rna , which stands for ribonucleic acid , is a molecule made up of one or more nucleotides
the liquid crystal droplets act as ' micro-reactors ' where short dna can join together into long polymer chains to evolve into more complex life ' our observations are suggestive of what may have happened on the early earth when the first dna - like molecular fragments appeared , ' said cu-boulder physics professor clark , a study co-author
