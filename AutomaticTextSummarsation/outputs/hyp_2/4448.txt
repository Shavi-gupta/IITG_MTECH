joe root ( left ) and ian bell ( right ) put on 177 runs for the fourth wicket on day one in antigua ian bell raises his bat to the crowd after scoring his 22nd test match century at the sir viv richards stadium ok , if they stay in the runs will come and england supporters will be happy but it should be remembered that england have promised to play a certain way
ben stokes was unbeaten on 71 at the close of play as england reached 341 for five ian bell and joe root lifted england 's run rate and got them out of a hole having fallen to 34 for three gary ballance has got this big backwards movement so to get him driving , and dismissing him the way the west indies did , represented a sucker punch
gary ballance was third to go for england on the first morning as he was dismissed by jason holder it 's difficult at times when you are in the bubble to remember what it means to be an england cricketer and i tried to emphasise that it is important , but you have to try to play down in your mind quite how important it is and enjoy the journey
