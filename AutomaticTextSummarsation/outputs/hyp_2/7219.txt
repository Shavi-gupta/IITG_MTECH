john , 37 , was last heard from by family in 2005 after he left nelson on the tasman bay to travel north
john , 37 , made contact with his family this week for the first time since 2005 over the years his family has hired investigators and police , but because he was an adult and had disappeared without notice before there was little incentive for police to appeal to the public for information
the family learned that john had never left the country , had no savings and did not possess a driver 's licence
