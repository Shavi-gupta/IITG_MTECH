a gel made from patients ' own blood could help heal burns more quickly - and stop wounds getting worse
it is made by taking a small amount of blood from a patient 's arm ( amounts vary depending on wound size , but typically no more than a couple of tablespoons ) and then processing it in a machine that spins the blood at high speed until it separates into its various components
u.s. researchers are testing the new gel it as a dressing for burns spinning the blood leaves behind the plasma and the platelets but in higher concentration - up to ten times greater than usual
