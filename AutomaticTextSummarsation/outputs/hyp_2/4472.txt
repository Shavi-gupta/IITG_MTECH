the solar probe plus will carry four experiments into the corona and study the solar wind and energetic particles as they blast off the surface of the star during the closest passes around the sun , temperatures outside the spacecraft will reach nearly 2,500 degrees fahrenheit
over 24 orbits , the mission will use seven flybys of venus to reduce its distance from the sun. the closest three will be just 3.8 million miles from the surface of the star
how it will get there : over 24 orbits , the mission will use seven flybys of venus to reduce its distance from the sun. the small car - sized spacecraft will plunge directly into the sun 's atmosphere approximately four million miles from our star 's surface
