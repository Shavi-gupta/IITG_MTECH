scientists have already cooked up the first test tube beef burger , but now researchers in israel are working on the world 's first lab - grown chicken
professor gefen , a bioengineer at tel aviv university , has begun a year - long feasibility study into manufacturing chicken in a lab , funded by a non-profit group called the modern agriculture foundation which hopes ' cultured meat ' will one day replace the raising of animals for slaughter
the researchers say their task is more difficult than producing the first lab - grown hamburger , a $ 300,000 beef patty cooked up at maastricht university in the netherlands after five years of research financed by google co-founder sergey brin
