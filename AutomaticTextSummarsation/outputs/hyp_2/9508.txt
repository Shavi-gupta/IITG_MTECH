aaron cresswell ( ipswich to west ham in july 2014 â Â£ 2million ) the full - back is one of just five outfield players to play every minute of his team 's premier league games this season aaron cresswell began at tranmere rovers , making his debut in november 2008
aaron cresswell has proved a good fit for the premier league since signing for west ham in july 2014 john stones ( barnsley to everton in january 2013 - Â£ 3m ) stones has the best passing accuracy of any everton player this season - 90.8 % a barnsley youth product , stones made 25 appearances in the championship for the club , before leaving for everton on a five - and - a - half - year deal
john stones signed for everton from barnsley in january 2013 for just Â£ 3m and has been a good addition andrew robertson ( dundee to hull in july 2014 - Â£ 2.85m ) andrew robertson has made 40 dribbles this year , 17 more than any other hull defender no disrespect to dundee or the scottish premiership , but it is widely assumed that the premier league is somewhat of a step up
