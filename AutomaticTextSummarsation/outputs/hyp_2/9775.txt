on a recent trip to paris , belgian food blogger van de ven enjoyed poking fun at those tourist clichÃ©s and took a couple of pictures deliberately missing some of the more famous monuments
since then over 100 photoshopped pictures have sprung up comically connecting his finger with the tip of the famous attraction , and it did n't stop there ... nailed it ! van de ven , 37 , uploaded this photograph on social media in a bid to poke fun of the typical tourist pictures going viral ! an upload on photo - sharing site 4chan requested users connect his finger with the top of the tower , as many tourist pictures aim to achieve the 37 - year - old said he thought it would be hilarious to deliberately make fun of the typical pictures with famous landmarks
bendy tower ! the tower appears to have flopped over in the summer heat , making a connection with the food blogger 's finger cut out ! despite covering the 37 - year - old , his finger is clearly in contact in this picture ! expert photoshopping creates a miniature tower touching his finger , never mind about the gaping white hole left behind ! close enough ! tilting the tower 45 degrees , and extending his arm in an octopus fashion were methods used to ' improve ' the picture super hero ! in a hulk - like fashion , not only has van de ven knocked over the eiffel tower , but also has it grasped in two fingers van de ven is shocked but highly entertained at the widespread response to his holiday pictures
