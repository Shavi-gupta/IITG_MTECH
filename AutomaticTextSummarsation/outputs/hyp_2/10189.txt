exeter has been dubbed ' too posh for monopoly ' after game makers were told there is nowhere low - rent enough to fill the space of old kent road it 's the most popular board game in the world , with hundreds of versions springing up in far - flung cities across the globe
but exeter has outdone all previous cities to get their own board - including oxford , cambridge and york - in the posh stakes , with no suggestions for the lower end
thousands of voters have suggested landmarks across exeter to fill the more expensive slots , such as the cathedral no one has come forward with ideas for which streets should fill the brown sections of the board , which cost $ 60 in monopoly money ' the board was designed on the streets of london and it is a nigh on impossible task to replicate that in exeter
