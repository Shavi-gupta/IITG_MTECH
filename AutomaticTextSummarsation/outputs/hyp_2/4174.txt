to compound alastair cook âs misery , there was also another failure for jonathan trott , who has endured a nightmare return to the england team for his 50th test , 18 months after the trauma of leaving the ashes tour following his 49th
alastair cook returned to something like his best last year with three half - centuries in his last four test innings against india but his woeful one - day form in sri lanka led england to jettisoning him as 50 - over captain ahead of the world cup
alastair cook failed with the bat once again on day three of the first test in antigua jonathan trott was also out cheaply as the first three wickets once again fell for not many james tredwell earlier picked up four wickets as england bowled west indies out for 295 in their first innings it is far too early to say that england âs gamble in bringing back a man who left australia with what was later diagnosed as â situational anxiety â has backfired but jonathan trott will be under significant pressure in the second test
