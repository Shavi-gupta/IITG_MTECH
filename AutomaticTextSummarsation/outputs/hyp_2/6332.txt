the continents of south america came together much earlier than previously thought , according to researchers who found evidence in rock deposits from ancient rivers in colombia of the land bridge that connected the long - isolated landmasses
the two continents are linked at panama , but there has been a debate about when this land bridge first appeared , with most experts placing its formation at about 3 million years ago
the researchers base their estimate on the presence of small grains of a mineral called zircon unearthed in ancient river bedrock in northern colombia that originated in panama and were 13 million to 15 million years old
