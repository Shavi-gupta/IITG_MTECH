rating : what on earth makes us think the french do off - beat restaurants with rooms better than us ? they do n't
seafood dining : mersea oysters are available year - round - as are colchester natives , when in season connected : the hotel is a two - minute walk from mistley station which has services to london liverpool street i had never heard of mistley , but what a fascinating spot , with a grand twin - towered church ( designed by robert adam ) that originally was meant to be a spa , gorgeous terraces of georgian houses , industrial buildings near the quay that have not yet been dolled up , a post office
well set : built as a coaching inn circa 1723 , the mistley thorn offers award - winning dining and accommodation weekends too : the sunday lunch menu features roast red poll beef and local sutton hoo chicken it is a sunday evening , and plenty are in for dinner - unless they are still here from lunch
