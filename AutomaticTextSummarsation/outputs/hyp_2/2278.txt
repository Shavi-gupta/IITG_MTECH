now , for the first time , researchers have shown that higher doses of vitamin e found in foods such as kale ( left ) and almonds , can mitigate the stress on immune cells whenever a virus or other pathogen enters our bodies , a certain class of immune cells - the t cells0 jump into action , spreading rapidly
a white blood cell , also known as a t cell , carries special structures on its surface with which to recognise specific pathogens if the immune cells lack repair enzyme gpx4 , the t cells die off as they divide , which means the immune system becomes weak and the infection can be chronic
