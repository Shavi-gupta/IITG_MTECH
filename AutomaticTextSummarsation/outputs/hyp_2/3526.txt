henry narrowly failed to pick up a despicable me toy as he played the notoriously difficult claw game at his local swimming pool in tamworth , staffordshire
struggle : it took workers half an hour to free henry as they searched for the keys to the machine free at last : henry eventually made his way out of the machine - and got to keep the cuddly toy ' he opened up the hatch and reached up to get it and when his bottom got under the hatch door it just flipped down
relief : henry 's mother emma said she could tell that the young boy was unhurt while in the machine venue : henry had just finished a swimming lesson at the snowdome in tamworth , pictured as staff hunted for the keys , mrs howes tried to encourage henry to open the machine from the inside , but he refused because he did n't want to release the teddy from his grasp
