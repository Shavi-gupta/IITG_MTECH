chris christie 's wife has quit her big - money job on wall street in what could be a sign her husband has decided to run for president in 2016
more of this ? the move is likely a precursor to christie 's bid for president - which would entail a lot of campaigning from mrs christie , pictured above with her husband in new hampshire her decision mirrors that of another wall street republican spouse - ted cruz 's wife , heidi . mrs cruz , whose husband was the first to launch his presidential campaign , immediately took unpaid leave from her high - powered position at goldman sachs , and will stay away from the office for the duration of his campaign
not the breadwinner : christie 's family tax returns show that his wife earns almost three times as much as him she reported a $ 510,000 total salary , made up of the $ 475,000 managing director 's pay packet and around $ 35,000 from a side job as a bond trader
