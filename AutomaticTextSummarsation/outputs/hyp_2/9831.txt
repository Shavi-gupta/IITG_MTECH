a zoo in ohio is celebrating the ' miracle ' birth of three rare amur tiger cubs after it was feared their mother 's biological clock had stopped ticking
in safe hands : while the birth on tuesday morning went smoothly , irisa failed to show any maternal care so her offspring are currently being hand - reared in an incubator taking it easy : video footage shows the newborn siblings writhing around and napping it is unknown when they will go on display to the public and how keepers will go about naming them
these are the first cubs for ten - year - old female , irisa , although the columbus zoo team and the species survival plan ( ssp ) had hoped for years she would reproduce and pass on her valuable genes
