as it stands , eubank will be making the first defence of his wba interim belt while saunders will have a warm - up ' international contest ' ahead of his challenge for the wbo middleweight title mooted for july
saunders and eubank jnr were involved in a war of words during the press conference saunders shows his unbeaten record to eubank jnr during a press conference eubank challenged saunders to take a re-match with him on may 9 hall of fame promoter warren initially played down the chances of the pair fighting in may , but later said he would work on trying to get the fight on but this show has been scheduled in a bid to build up a rematch between them , with promoter warren suggesting an autumn rematch
saunders got the better of eubank over 12 rounds when the pair met back in november eubank and saunders are both keen on a re-match and while may 9 is a possibility an autumn fight is more realistic defeat for saunders or eubank before the rematch could damage the credibility of the fight and warren knows it could be in everybody 's best interest to get the fight on as quickly as possible
