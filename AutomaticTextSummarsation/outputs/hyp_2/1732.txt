a small ' hot spot ' in the u.s. southwest is responsible for producing the largest concentration of the greenhouse gas methane seen over the united states - and is the subject of a major new investigation to find out why
the hot spot , near the four corners intersection of arizona , colorado , new mexico and utah , covers only about 2,500 square miles ( 6,500 square kilometers ) , or half the size of connecticut
researchers from several institutions are now in the four corners region of the u.s. southwest with a suite of airborne and ground - based instruments , aiming to uncover reasons for a mysterious methane ' hot spot ' detected from space
