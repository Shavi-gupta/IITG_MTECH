when scottish student caitlin mcneill , 21 , posted a photo of a blue and black dress that looked white and gold from some angles , it sparked an internet debate so furious even a-listers could n't resist getting involved
' grey : many viewers watching the debate thought miss sturgeon 's dress was grey different colour : in a photo taken as she left the studio , miss sturgeon 's dress appeared to be blue going for green : under the studio lights , miss sturgeon 's get - up seemed to be green back to grey : in this photo of miss sturgeon with the green 's natalie bennett , it once again looks grey not everyone was interested in the change in colour , which is likely to have been the result of harsh studio lights producing a different hue to the one seen in natural daylight , however
not impressed : one viewer declared her concerns about the debate overshadowing the snp manifesto be serious ! another said viewers debating the colour of the dress were missing the point of the evening the original : this was the frock that sparked the original # thedress debate slick : miss sturgeon has been lauded for her dress sense and is seen here at the scottish leaders ' debate stylish : miss sturgeon claims to be uninterested in clothes but admits to a passion for kurt geiger shoes although the snp leader claims to be uninterested in splashing out on expensive clothes and bags in the past , she has admitted to a weakness for shoes , albeit kurt geiger rather than jimmy choo
