judith chalmers and her husband travelled to the city and it did nât take them long to discover the unique appeal of macau after lunch at cafe litoral ( a fusion of portuguese , china , indian , south american , african and malaysian flavours â it works ! ) we headed over to the tower , which has the world âs highest bungee jump
