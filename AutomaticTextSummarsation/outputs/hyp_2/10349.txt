ronaldo did n't have too much joy with his trademark free - kicks during madrid 's victory over neighbours atletico this week - but it did n't stop him from showing his compassionate side
ronaldo shows his delight after madrid finally broke the deadlock against rivals atletico but it was a different story before the game as ronaldo expressed his concern after his shot hit a supporter after completing his warm - up routine ronaldo went over to the touchline and lifted off his training shirt after receiving the forward 's shirt the young supporter was clearly overcome with emotion at the kind act as the former manchester united forward trained his sights with long - range attempts , one effort flew wide of the target and into the crowd , striking a young supporter in the front row
madrid made hard work of a well - drilled atletico side , but it was poster - boy ronaldo 's pass into javier hernandez that killed off the valiant attempts of diego simeone 's 10 men in the 88th minute of the local affair - much to the delight of the stricken fan and the majority of those at the bernabeu
