there will be calls for england to get rid of cook and trott on the back of their failures here but i think they should both play all three tests against west indies before any sort of decision is made
trott ( left ) and cook head out to open england 's second innings against west indies trott walks past cook after he was dismissed for just four runs by jerome taylor on day three i said after the first day of this test that england âs top order was a bit one - paced which could be an issue but that does not mean i think they should be dropped unless there is conclusive evidence they are in decline
trott was making his first test appearance for england in 18 months against the west indies he has to tell himself to calm down , stay still and chill a bit at the crease and it will be hard because the duke ball is swinging and he is not accustomed to being an opener
