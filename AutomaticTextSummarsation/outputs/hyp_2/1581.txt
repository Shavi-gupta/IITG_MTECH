but a team of experts at brandeis university in massachusetts have a few words of wisdom , urging students to put down the coffee and sleep
a team of scientists at brandeis university in massachusetts believe all - nighters to cram before an exam wo n't work because the process converting short - term memory to long - term memory is best carried out when a person is asleep but just how that process works has remained a mystery
in other words , is memory consolidated during sleep because the brain is quiet , allowing memory neurons to go to work , or are memory neurons actually putting us to sleep ? graduate students , haynes and christmann , at the university 's griffith lab , believe the answer is the latter
