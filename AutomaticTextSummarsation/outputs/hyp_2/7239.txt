former dragons â den star bannatyne this morning announced he would back labour at the next election â just a week after backing the tories speaking in coventry this morning , labour leader miliband claimed the 200 - year - old ' non dom ' rule makes uk an ' offshore tax haven for a few ' and can ' no longer be justified ' the tories warned the plan could cost uk ' hundreds of millions of pounds ' and stopped short of scrapping the rules , despite labour 's claims
mr bannatyne was one of the former prime minister gordon brown 's most prominent backers - and was wheeled out ahead of the 2010 election ( above ) to boost the party 's business credentials mr miliband said non-dom status results from a discredited belief that ' anything goes for those at the top and that what is good for the rich is always good for uk '
