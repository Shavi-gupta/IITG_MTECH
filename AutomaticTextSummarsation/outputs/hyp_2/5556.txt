at least , that seemed to be the case for one young shibu inu , who caused hilarity with a somewhat chatty display at an american kennel club centre
the pup was filmed squeaking and squawking after meeting a young husky dog and attempting to bark at its new companion
captured on video , the puppies are held in the air by their respective handlers and one of the dogs makes a high - pitched whining sound
