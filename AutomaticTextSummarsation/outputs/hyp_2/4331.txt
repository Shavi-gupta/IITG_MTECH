bouncing around : a young bull rider takes on a bullock ( steer ) at a rodeo in fort worth , texas but each time he gets on a bullock , a castrated male , he risks life and limb , and has already been trampled on several times
ouch ! most bull riders are speedily thrown off - a good result is eight seconds hitting the deck : an estimated one in 15 bull rides across all age groups ends in injury of some sort starting small : the youngest children hone their skills on sheep before graduating to calves but as the stakes get higher , pressure to breed bulls that are more athletic , more vicious and bigger than ever before has increased - including in the junior division
not happy : even the calves , such as the one pictured , can pack a hefty punch if enraged moving on : the next step is to ride bullocks ( castrated young males ) before culminating in big bulls tough task : bullocks , who are often approaching the size of a full - grown female , are no easy ride now seven , jayden , the youngest , has graduated onto calves while lance takes on bullocks and joe wrangles bulls
