beach - goers were faced with a different kind of sea creature when they entered the water at victoria 's picturesque rye beach last week - a swimming echidna ! the prickly australian mammal was filmed paddling out to sea in the turquoise waters off the mornington peninsula , 83 km south of melbourne
they like the water so much , that the zoo built a special swimming pool for its echidna residents to cool off on hot summer days
echidnas , like many native australian animals , are actually ' proficient ' swimmers - though they usually prefer fresh water to the open ocean the echidna - or spiny ant - eater - is found all over australia , in coastal forests , alpine meadows and desert habitats
