a 1921 application form to join the racist kkk organisation has emerged , which asks â are you of the white race or of a colored race ? â the form asks a further 19 questions ranging from the mundane , such as â what is your age ? â , to the overtly sinister â â do you believe in white supremacy ? â at the top is an introduction implying that it is intended to be sent out to people whose friends have identified them as suitable recruits
in a blog post ian brabner explained that the numbers â 8 - 2 - 21 â in the top left corner of the unused form would have stood for the date â august 2 , 1921
they also include â do you believe in the principles of a pure americanism ? â , â are you a gentile or jew ? â and â were your parents born in the us ? â the kkk was founded in 1866 in tennessee , with forrest becoming the first leader , or grand wizard , in 1867
