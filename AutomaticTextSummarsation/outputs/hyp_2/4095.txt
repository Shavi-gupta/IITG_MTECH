in a case which has strikingly similar traits to the Â£ 60m heist in london , thieves targeted 294 security vaults during a break - in at the volksbank in steglitz , berlin , in january 2013
during that near - identical raid - one of the biggest in london 's jewellery quarter - 71 security boxes were raided before the gang made off with wheelie bins full of precious stones
suspects caught on cctv during the london heist were also dressed as construction workers - a tactic used in the berlin raid in a similar fashion to the germany heist , the burglars timed their raid over the easter bank holiday , entering after the premises emptied on thursday night and leaving on easter sunday the men then climbed back up to the ground floor to let other gang members in through a side entrance , before all making their way to the vaults where they drilled their way inside
