albarn said modern pop stars are part of a ' selfie generation ' that just sings about platitudes he was once the driving force behind britpop in the 1990s and became known for his very public spat with oasis ' gallagher brothers
albarn has criticised today 's pop stars for ' talking platitudes ' and singing only about themselves , at a time when , he believes , they could be using their music to make political statements in the run up to the general election
albarn 's criticisms are also likely to resonate with people who have been scornful about the work of modern day pop stars such as taylor swift and sam smith who are known for using their singles to express their emotions about failed relationships
