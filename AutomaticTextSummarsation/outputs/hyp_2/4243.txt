president obama and cuba president raul shook hands last night ahead of a historic meeting which may see cuba declassified as a state sponsor of terrorism
the gesture of friendships is an outward symbol of obama 's project to thaw diplomatic relations with cuba , which have been frozen since the 1960s
' but the 53 - year - old obama , who was not even born when fidel and raul swept to power in cuba 's 1959 revolution , also said the u.s. is no longer interested in trying to impose its will on latin america
