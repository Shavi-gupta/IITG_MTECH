visitors who venture onto or too close to north sentinel island risk being attacked by members of a mysterious tribe who have rejected modern civilisation and prefer to have zero contact with the outside world
when they do interact with outsiders , it usually involves violence â the indigenous sentinelese tribe killed two men who were fishing illegally in 2006 and have been known to fire arrows and fling rocks at low - flying planes or helicopters on reconnaissance missions
the tribespeople are rarely photographed or recorded on video ; the only existing images or video clips tend to be of poor quality to protect the sentinelese people - and visitors - the indian ocean government has established a three - mile exclusion zone often referred to as a â stone age tribe â â a title that advocates take offence to , as its members have adapted over time â the sentinelese may be the most isolated tribe in the world , with the indian ocean government choosing not to meddle in their affairs
