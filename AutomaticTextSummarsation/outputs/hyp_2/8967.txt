we take a look at the contract wrangle and ask : could he really end up at manchester united ? dani alves , out of contract at the end of the campaign , is pictured training for barcelona on friday his contract runs out on june 30 why has it come to this ? barcelona had never planned to keep dani alves beyond this season
barcelona defender dani alves has been sounded out by manchester united over a move to old trafford and there are other clubs who will gladly take him ? after weeks of rumours that the suitors were queuing around the nou camp to sign him up it now seems that one big club has offered him a three - year deal with none of the strings , sub-clauses and trap - doors as the barcelona deal
you sound doubtful â¦ only in as much as if manchester united had really offered him a three - year deal would he still be haggling with barcelona ? surely a premier league swansong at old trafford is the perfect way to round off what has been a remarkable career with the spain giants â winning four leagues , three cups and two champions league titles
