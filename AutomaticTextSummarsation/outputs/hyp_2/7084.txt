troubling questions : lord janner controversially escaped prosecution for a string of child abuse allegations because the cps said alzheimer âs has left him unfit to face trial a former dpp has said lawyers involved in the decision not to charge janner with child abuse in 2007 failed to pass new evidence to him
lord macdonald qc , who was dpp between 2003 and 2008 , said that instead of consulting with headquarters in london , cps lawyers in leicestershire decided fresh evidence against janner was not worth pursuing through the courts
that decision meant janner , now 86 , was able to escape prosecution for eight years until the cps controversially announced earlier this week that he is now unfit to stand trial due to alzheimer 's
