the conservatives have opened up a four - point lead over labour with millions of voters yet to make up their minds about how to vote in the tightest election race since 1992
an exclusive poll by comres for the daily mail and itv news shows that david cameron âs party , on 36 per cent of the vote , has moved ahead in the last fortnight as labour , the lib dems and ukip have all slipped
however , 25 per cent of both tory and labour voters say that they would consider voting lib dems , suggesting that the party still has some hope of winning over voters on either side of the political spectrum
