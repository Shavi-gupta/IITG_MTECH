a czech politician says he has created an entirely new country by claiming three - square - mile patch of land along the croatia - serbia border that neither country claims is theirs
jedlicka , 31 , a member of the czech 's conservative party of free citizens , is the self - declared president of ' liberland ' , which is located on the banks of the danube
hope : if liberland is ever formally recognised it will become the third smallest sovereign state in the world , behind the vatican city and monaco mr jedlicka describes himself as a libertarian and says citizens living in ' liberland ' will be able to set their own individual rate of tax , as well as drawing up their own property and personal rights
