the 45 - year - old , whose top gear future has been in doubt since clarkson 's unceremonious sacking , has released his first home video on a new channel on youtube
he is seen shouting at the top of his voice - to no one except his dog - that he is ' bored ! ' the slickly - edited video then follows hammond as he drives along the m6 and country roads to buttermere in the lake district , cumbria
but , unlike his top gear presenting style , hammond rarely speaks during the film , sharing only a few key insights such as : ' it 's raining ' and ' what are we doing ? ' the film then ends with a cliff hanger which shows hammond releasing some of the sheep back onto his farm in wales - but realising that he has left his beloved dog behind
