this incredible image was captured above pitcaple in aberdeenshire yesterday as photographer graeme whipps picked up two meteors which were part of the lyrid meteor shower
the annual celestial event has been observed for the last 2,700 years across the globe , but is most visible in the northern hemisphere , and is expected to peak tonight with between 10 and 20 meteors an hour
the lyrids are created by debris from comet thatcher , which takes about 415 years to orbit around the sun , and appear to radiate outwards from a star known as vega and the constellation lyra in which it sits - which gives the meteors their name
