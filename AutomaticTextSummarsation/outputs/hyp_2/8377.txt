the winter of 2014 - 15 wo n't be easily forgotten in boston after the endless snow broke countless records and the city had to pay volunteers $ 30 an hour to help dig out the battered city
vlad tarasov even filmed his journey down the slopes at boston 's largest snow farm located in the city 's seaport district
' i 've been skiing for 20 years , but never like this , ' said vlad tarasov about the ' surreal ' experience junk in the filthy snow included rusted lawn chairs , parking cones , broken bottles and even a dead seagull ' i 'm so accustomed to skiing on the white stuff
