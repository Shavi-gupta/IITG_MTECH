zlatan has made the headlines throughout his trophy - laden career but it appears a novel way has been created to find any information purely about the maverick 32 - year - old striker
zlatan has had a search engine website created in his honour called zlaaatan.com the website has an identical style to google with users given the option to ' zlatan search ' or ' i 'm feeling zlatan ' in a house style that is identical to google , and operates just like the search engine , users have the option to ' zlatan search ' or ' i 'm feeling zlatan
the website though has no affliation with the psg no 10 ( left ) nor google creative director of sweetpop , the agency that came up with the website idea , andreas killander hopes the search engine will bring a smile to the sweden international
