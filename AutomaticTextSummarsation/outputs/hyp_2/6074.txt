amie , 33 , of victoria made the ready admission of the sensory bond she has for son alex , 5 , over her older boy william , 7 , while appearing on an sbs insight programme about sibling rivalry
she said that the bond with alex 's scent began from the first moment she held him after giving birth and that for the first six to 12 months of his life she did n't want anyone else to touch him or ' rub their smell on him ' because it would interfere with his unique and special smell
amie says five - year - old alex ( left ) who has the special smell which she appreciates because of the science of pheromones is ' a terror ' while his brother william , 7 ( centre ) is more easygoing but both boys get the same amount of toys and love and she is a normal mother despite being attacked online as ' a freak ' the 33 - year - old said attacks on her for admitting she is very attracted to her younger son 's scent are ' water off a duck 's back ' and that ' it does n't bother me ' because she is a good mother who gives her older son william just as many hugs as she does alex ' are such disputes unavoidable , and do tensions always persist into adulthood ? ' insight asks ' if competition and conflict between siblings is a good thing , and whether favouritism can affect this
