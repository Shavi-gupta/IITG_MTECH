now , researchers have created a special robo - explorer to borrow into the ice and record the first footage of what lies on the seabed below the ross ice shelf
the icefin was deployed ( and retrieved ) the vehicle through a 12 - inch diameter hole through 20 meters of ice and another 500 meters of water to the sea floor
icefin 's readings of the environment under antartica 's ice shelves , and video of the life that thrives in these harsh conditions , will help understand how antartica 's ice shelves are changing under warming conditions , and to understand how organisms thrive in cold and light - free environments
