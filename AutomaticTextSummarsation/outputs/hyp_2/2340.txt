â james is nearly 16 , and i âm painfully aware that my years of holidaying with him are coming to a close
unknown : wigry national park , in north - east poland , is the furthest outreach of the masurian lakes our destination is wigry national park , in the north - east of the country , close to the lithuanian border
a holiday of an old - fashioned kind : jane found a refreshing simplicity to this pretty corner of poland it is all so wholesome that , as we sit by another pristine lake , watching the sun dip down , i find myself singing old campfire songs as james takes another swim
