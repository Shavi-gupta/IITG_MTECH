above , a friend of scott 's at a memorial the officer who shot scott , michael slager , had little in his file to suggest excessive force
the mostly black neighborhood in north charleston where slager fired eight shots at the back of walter lamer scott on saturday is far from unique in this regard , said tucker , a former fbi agent and police chief in four southern cities who often testifies in police misconduct cases
video captured by a bystander to the shooting showed slager fire eight shots at the back of scott as he ran away original statements from slager said that he felt threatened by scott , though video released appears to contradict the police account of the incident a dash cam video from police shows scott running away from his car during a traffic stop for a broken tail light slager consistently earned positive reviews in his five years with the north charleston police
