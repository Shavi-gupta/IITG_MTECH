when these are placed in a clip on module ( b ) that attaches to a iphone camera ( c ) the microbeads produce distinctive diffraction patterns when they clump around a diseased cell ( top right ) when added to a tissue or blood sample , these microbeads bind to any cancerous cells in the sample , changing the way light passes through it
the graphic above shows how the new device works with a iphone to analyse samples for signs of cancer the images above show how the microbeads ( small white circles in bottom images ) clump around cells ( dotted lines ) in samples that were found to be of high risk of cervical cancer ( left ) low risk ( middle ) and benign ( right ) by attaching specific antibodies to the beads , it is possible to make them bind to these molecules , meaning they will gather around a cancerous cell in a tissue or blood sample
the images above show how the diffraction patterns created by beads and cells change when the beads clump around a cell , highlighting cancerous cells ( bottom ) compared to a healthy cell ( top ) they found that their results were between 92 % and 100 % accurate when compared to the current ' gold standard ' diagnostic test
