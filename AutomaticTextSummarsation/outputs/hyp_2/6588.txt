they have a tv channel devoted to it , and one show â a sort of bulgaria âs got talent for folk acts â features people of all ages swaying in stately unison
indeed , they are so proud of the music that when asked to include something in the capsule aboard the voyager 2 space probe , they sent tracks from the album le mystere des voix bulgares , in the hope that aliens would like it too
colourful outfits ! villagers dressed in the traditional bulgaria costume i love this kind of folklore as long as it really is part of the local culture and not just put on for tourists
