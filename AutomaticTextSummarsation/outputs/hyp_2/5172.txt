fresh fears were raised last night that greek could exit the eurozone after it was claimed negotiations with its europe creditors were â not working â
thomsen 's prediction was made as the greek government repeated previous threats that unless more bail out money was made available then it would stop paying back creditors this would make it harder for the country to remain in the eurozone , although no state has ever left and there is no official exit process
greek repaid a roughly â¬ 450 million loan instalment to the imf last week but athens ' financial problems , as outlined by mr. thomsen , have renewed fears the country might miss the imf payment of â¬ 200m payment on the 1st may and another for â¬ 745m 11 days later
