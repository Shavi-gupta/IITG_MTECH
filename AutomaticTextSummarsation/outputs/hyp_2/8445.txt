farage has proclaimed that he will ' smash apart ' labour 's ' one - party state ' in the north at the election
' mr farage accused labour 's shadow business secretary chuka umunna of making ' tired and old claims ' after he said at the weekend that ukip is infected with the ' virus of racism '
worried : mr farage said labour are ' running scared ' of his ukip while most people pay no heed when they hear these claims nowadays , it is interesting to think about why labour chiefs are attacking ukip , when they really should be focusing on mr cameron 's conservatives by this point in the campaign
