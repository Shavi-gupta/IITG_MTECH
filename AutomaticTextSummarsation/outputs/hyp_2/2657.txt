as waters around the uk get warmer , popular species of fish including haddock , plaice and lemon sole could become less common as they migrate to more preferable water temperatures
from this they predicted the abundance and distribution of popular fish , such as haddock and plaice , could fall as the north sea warms and this could increase the price of fish and chips in the past 40 years , reports suggest the north sea has warmed four times faster than the global average
as a result uk fisheries will need to replace current species with those that prefer warmer water such as red mullet ( left ) and john dory ( right ) , for example their research found that as the north sea warms , species wo n't be able to migrate north to avoid warming temperatures because habitat of a suitable depth is rare
