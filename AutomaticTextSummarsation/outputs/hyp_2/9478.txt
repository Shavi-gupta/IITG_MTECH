a spanish expert , dr celia sanchez-ramos , has found the led screens found in most electronic devices can harm the retina - the light - sensitive layer at the back of the eye - and may even lead to partial blindness
research has already shown that the intense levels of ' blue light ' emitted from modern gadgets can cause a variety of health complaints , ranging from sleeping and eating problems to headaches and even cancer
according to dr celia sanchez-ramos , modern led screens , produced from about 2007 onwards , emit up to five times as much blue light as older technology
