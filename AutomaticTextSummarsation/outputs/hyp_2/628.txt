the other day i was driving past the port at bristol and i saw all those thousands of cars lined up on the quayside â and whoa â¦ i did a double take
they were examples of british manufacturing and design and engineering â and they were about to be loaded on to ships and taken to other europe countries , and to africa , and asia ; and i reflected on one of the most stunning turnaround stories in the economic history of this country
the lib dems under nick clegg would probably settle for any epoch in which they were above five per cent in the polls it is only the conservatives that understand the real economic and social significance of all those british cars lined up at bristol
