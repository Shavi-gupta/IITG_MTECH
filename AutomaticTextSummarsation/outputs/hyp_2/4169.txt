eye of the beholder by snyder the behaviour of dutchman natural scientist van leeuwenhoek was nothing if not eccentric
van leeuwenhoek ( pictured in a portrait ) used his body as a guinea pig in an experiment he took three lice , nestled them among the hairs of his calf , rolled up a tight stocking so that the insects were bound to his leg and then left the stocking on and did not bathe for six days
she asks an intriguing question : could vermeer and van leeuwenhoek , who were born in the same week , lived and worked their entire lives in an area not much larger than a football pitch , and who had friends in common , have exchanged ideas and inspired each other âs work ? this is much more than a joint biography
