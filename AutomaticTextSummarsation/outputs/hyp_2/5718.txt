campaigners are calling for the government to implement an almost 90 - year - old law that would fix the date of easter in a bid to boost the economy
after next month 's election , ministers could be asked to make sure easter sunday always falls between april 9 and 15 , so businesses can plan holiday rotas in advance and allow the travel industry to better prepare for the summer season
after next month 's general election , minister could be asked to consider fixing the date of easter both the house of commons and house of lords passed the act but it was unable to get the agreement of churches and therefore has never been implemented
