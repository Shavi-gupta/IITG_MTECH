the researchers found that predator ' hoos ' in particular were produced at frequencies well below the threshold of hearing for eagles and other birds of prey
lar gibbons used hoo calls to warn each other of predators but also during more intimate moments like this the researchers used models like of this snake to test whether certain hoo calls were specific to predators different hoo calls appeared to be related to the activity the gibbons were taking part in like foraging ( above ) using modern recording technology and computer analysis , dr clarke and her colleagues have been able to detect subtle differences in frequency , pitch , length and volume of these calls
this model of a bird of prey produced short , low frequency and extremely quiet calls from the gibbons this model of a leopard also produced low frequency and quiet calls from the gibbons when they spotted it the researchers used a series of models of predators to test whether the calls were associated with specific predators
