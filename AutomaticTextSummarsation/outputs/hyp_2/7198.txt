this is the incredible moment a tiger was sent crashing to the floor after mistiming an attack on a fleet - footed bird
oops - a - daisy ! this tiger lots its footing in spectacular style while trying to catch a chicken at a zoo in northeast china on the attack : at first all was well , with the tiger homing straight in on an airborne feathery meal target : as the bird flew upwards the tiger began to rear up , ready to grab its prey from the air fail : the tiger began to slip as the bird flew higher and higher in a blind panic - and it was all caught on camera by photographer libby zhang hang time : the slip caused the tiger to flip right onto its back , with the bird now well out of reach but momentum caused its feet to slide away from underneath and go skidding along the slippery ground
love your tiger feet : the hilarious moment took place at the hengdaohezi siberian tiger park in northeast china roaringly funny : the photographer said that a watching crowd burst out laughing when the tiger fell over she said : ' the crowd burst out in a roar of laughter - it was during feeding time and several chickens were tossed at the tigers
