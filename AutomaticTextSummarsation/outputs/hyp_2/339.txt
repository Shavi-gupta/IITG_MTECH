sainsbury 's is set to revolutionise how we do our weekly shop by letting us scan items in our home as they run out
the sainsbury 's app is in development and will be trialled in wandsworth later this year
the app is an extension of sainsbury 's current scan-and-go scheme ( pictured ) , which lets customers scan items on their phone as they journey around the store
