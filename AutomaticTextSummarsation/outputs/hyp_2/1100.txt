a ' superhero ' scientist has ventured into one of the most radioactive places in the world - scaling missile defence system towers , getting bitten by ' radioactive ' ants and eating contaminated apples that have grown on trees close to chernobyl 's epicentre
anonymous scientist bionerd has attracted thousands of subscribers to her youtube channel for her visits into the chernobyl exclusion zone , the site of a devastating nuclear explosion 29 years ago on april 26 , 1986 , as she measures the high levels of radiation still lingering in the air
bionerd says visiting the abandoned site is like stepping back in time damage : the broken pressure gauges from the nuclear power station 's control room after the nuclear reactor exploded 29 years ago relaxed : bionerd at the foot of the russian woodpecker radar system - known as the russian woodpecker - in the heart of the chernobyl exclusion zone ' time stopped the moment the reactor blew , and i do n't just mean the readings on the clocks ... and if you embrace it , you can understand the zone 's true meaning
