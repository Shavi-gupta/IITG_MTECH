three 's company : rebecca and husband harry settle in at anantara the palm jumeirah my husband harry and i knew this was going to be a landmark holiday - the last one on our own for a long time
our baby girl is due on june 4 and , when we touched down in dubai , i was 28 weeks pregnant
because it has over-the - water bungalows there were times when it felt like we were in the maldives , but when we went to the australian themed restaurant , i imagined i was back in the jungle on i 'm a celebrity â even though there were n't any luxuries in that jungle
