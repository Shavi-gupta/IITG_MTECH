ukip 's election campaign chief has admitted that the party sometimes resembles a ' rugby club on tour ' with members who can be ' boorish ' and ' chauvinistic '
as he launched the party 's ' policies for women ' alongside the ukip deputy chairman ukip and mep diane james , mr patrick o'flynn was forced to defend its ' blokeish ' image under farage
patrick o'flynn , who is also the party 's economics spokesman , said ukip needs to ' work harder ' as it is ' lagging ' behind with female voters polls suggest around 15 per cent of men are planning to back ukip , compared to only 10 per cent of women
