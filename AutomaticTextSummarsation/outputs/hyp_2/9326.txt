the shepherd âs life : a tale of the lake district by rebanks when , in 2002 , my family and i moved from busy north london to bucolic north herefordshire , we found that our new neighbours were , overwhelmingly , sheep
i did nât want to be one of those townies who moves to the country but remains ignorant of rural ways , so i made sporadic efforts to get to know them , or at least , to get to understand life on a sheep farm
rebanks studied at the oxford before returning to his roots in the lake district , he is seen here with his sheep on his farm outside of penrith in cumbria it is the enlightening , exquisitely written account , give or take a few autobiographical tangents , of a year in the life of rebanks , whose family has been farming in the lake district for at least six centuries
