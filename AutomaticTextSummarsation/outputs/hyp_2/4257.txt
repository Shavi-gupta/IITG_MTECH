a simulated image from 1996 is on the left , and another from 2014 is on the right the star â known as w75n ( b ) - vla2 â is 300 times brighter and eight times bigger than our sun , although it is masked by a black cloud of space dust
the pictures , created by data from 27 radio telescope antennae in the new mexico desert in the u.s. , show the electrified wind expanding away from the star until it is slowed by the black and yellow cloud of dust surrounding it
