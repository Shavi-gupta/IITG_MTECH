kings forward jarret stoll was arrested on friday in vegas , nevada , on drug possession charges , and looked wide - eyed and alert in his mugshot
stoll , 32 , is the longtime boyfriend of dancing with the stars host andrews , a former espn employee who now works as an nfl sideline reporter for fox
it seems that stoll went on a date with andrews on thursday night , as she posted a photo of a romantic - looking candle that was seemingly taken at italian restaurant la sosta enoteca in manhattan beach , california , on her instagram page , and a fan snapped a photo with stoll earlier in the day in the same neighborhood
