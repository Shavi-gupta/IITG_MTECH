ciudad real airport was built in 2009 at a cost of more â¬ 1billion â spain âs economy having taken off â but was closed three years later when its parent company fell into financial difficulties
the airport was designed to cater for spain 's booming economy to serve both city and coast via a high speed rail link
the airport was projected to take the overflow from madrid 's barajas airport , some 150 miles to the north contrast : the high speed train , which was supposed to serve the airport , whizzes by as the airport stands redundant a high speed train accelerates past the airport , which closed in 2012 derelict : ciudad real 's airport was supposed to be a symbol of modern spain , but is now being left to rack and ruin wasteland : the vast stretch of runway and massive area of landing surrounding it remain empty but the last budget airline to operate from its terminals stopped flying in late 2011 and when the final private flights stopped a few months later , the airport shut up shop
