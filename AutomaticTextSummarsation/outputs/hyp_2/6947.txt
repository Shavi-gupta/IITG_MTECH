target : groups of men and women were asked whether they would kill a young hitler to prevent second world war it is a classic question of morality - if you could travel back in time and prevent the second world war by killing a young hitler , would you ? you could hypothetically save millions of lives - but at the cost of personally murdering someone who had yet to do anything wrong
