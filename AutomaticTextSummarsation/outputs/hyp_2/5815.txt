delta 's new pet gps , available for $ 50 per flight , allows owners to track their pets on a plane via a website the move was no doubt aimed to make passengers feel safer about bringing their pets with them on flights , as delta has a less than rosy history of pet fatalities on board
the service is available from 10 us airlines including los angeles and atlanta two months ago it was reported that delta failed to load a number of show dogs on a flight , and staff admitted they did not know where the prized pets were , when they were asked by customers
owners of pets at the westminster dog show in new york were told their pets were not on board their delta flight , and disembarked to go and find them the pets were safely retrieved , but the airlines has had a number of animal related incidents in the past
