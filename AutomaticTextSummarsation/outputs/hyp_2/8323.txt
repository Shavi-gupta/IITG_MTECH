i âve had close - up experience with three of the world âs five surviving species of rhino : the white rhino looks like the main battle tank of an extra-terrestrial army , while the black is more like a hot - rod armoured car
so why are we running out of them ? why does the last surviving male of the northern sub-species of the white rhino now live under a 24 - hour guard ? why has he been stripped of his horn ? why is it that we seem to be on the brink of losing an entire race of rhinos ? threatened : sudan is the target of poachers looking to sell rhino horn which can make up to Â£ 47,000 a kilo this is the lonely rhino , known as sudan , guarded day and night by rangers who risk their own lives as they try to keep him from poachers
extreme measures : rangers have even cut off the rhino 's horn - but they fear it wo n't be enough hungry : feeding time in sudan 's enclosure - he spent most of his life in a czech zoo there are also many good projects for rhino conservation in africa and across the world
