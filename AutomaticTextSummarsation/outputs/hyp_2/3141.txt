ask any peru where the best place to party is and you 'll always get the same reply : ' puno ! ' the city 's colourful fiestas , combining spanish and inca traditions , often last for days
reeds all about it : hand - crafted boats on the gentle surface of lake titicaca arriving in puno , you wonder at first where on earth the inhabitants get their energy
a glimpse of traditional peru : you can meet uru islanders , and go inside their homes , on the lake like sark , cars are banned here , but the island 's elders also forbid beasts of burden , such as donkeys and horses , which leaves the locals to lug everything around on their backs
