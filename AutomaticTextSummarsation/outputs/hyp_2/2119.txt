sauntering down leafy avenues past typical dutch step - Â­ gabled buildings , carpets of crocuses , the occasional cyclist whooshing quietly by and the sun bouncing off the canal , i can think of few more pleasant places to spend a spring weekend than hague
much more than a village : the parliament building stands proud in hague - a hidden gem of a city there is the escher gallery ( devoted to that geometry - Â­ defying genius ) , the contemporary art gemeentemuseum and more
he is right : the hague , despite being home to holland 's royal family and an eye - Â­ catching parliament , was classed as a village until louis bonaparte ( napoleon 's brother and king of holland ) set up here in 1806
