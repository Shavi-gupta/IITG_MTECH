research led by a scientist at the new jersey institute of technology has revealed the first high - resolution footage of a solar flux ' rope ' taking shape on the sun , shown in this still image the new footage was revealed in a paper in nature communications led by dr wang from the new jersey institute of technology
a solar flare accompanies the twisting flux rope in the footage , which moves around a common axis before bursting from the sun. they are essentially twisted bundles of magnetic field that extend out of and back into the surface across hundreds of kilometres
solar flux ropes are common structures in the solar corona , and they are thought to be the main cause of several types of solar weather â including solar flares and coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) , pictured
