the large hadron collider was restarted today after being turned off for two years during a major renovation project that cost Â£ 100million
physicists at cern , the geneva - based organisation which runs the large hadron collider , are aiming to see dark matter for the first time ever thanks to the device 's upgrade
ambition : scientists hope the machine will be able to detect and describe dark matter for the first time the large hadron collider , which cost nearly Â£ 4billion , is currently running at a low ' injection ' energy of 450 giga - electron volts ( tev ) , but in june it will increase to a record - breaking 13 tera - electron volts ( tev ) - up from 7 tev at the time it managed to detect the higgs boson in 2013
