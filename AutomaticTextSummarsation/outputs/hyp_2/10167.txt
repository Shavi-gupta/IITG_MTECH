called the t - pylon ( artist 's illustration shown ) it is a third shorter than the old lattice pylons
uk 's first pylon , erected in july 1928 near edinburgh , was designed by architectural luminary sir reginald blomfield , inspired by the greek root of the word â pylon â ( meaning gateway of an egyptian temple )
t - pylons were the winners of a 2011 design competition to develop a new pylon that could deal with changing sources of electricity ( others shown right ) the simplistic design , composed mostly of just eight components , means new t - pylons can be erected in just a single day , rather than a whole week for older pylons maintenance is also easier , as engineers do not need to climb the pylons , but can simply work on them from an elevated platform
