the women filled in a notebook each , and handed it back to dove unbeknownst to the women , those negative remarks and self - body shaming were turned into a script created in france , dove asked a group of women - all beautiful and impeccably chic - to write down every thought they had about themselves in a notebook
dove recruited two undercover actresses to read the script , created using the notes each of the women made about themselves , while they were all within earshot
