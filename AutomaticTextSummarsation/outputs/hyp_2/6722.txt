his reaction to losing to hamilton â blaming the brit for slowing down and bunching him up as the attacking ferrari of vettel closed on him â told us more about his own state of mind than it offered fair criticism of hamilton
rosberg ( left ) looks less than impressed after finishing second to mercedes team - mate hamilton the german driver blamed hamilton for slowing down and bunching him up as vettel closed in rosberg ( left ) , hamilton ( second right ) and ferrari driver vettel celebrate on the podium in china it was all the more remarkable given that rosberg was for so much of last season the ultimate expression of focus , coolness , intelligence and calculation
rosberg 's attitude seems to have changed in the aftermath of his crash with hamilton in spa last august it was my view then and remains so that rosberg was marginally more to blame for the collision , but that it was no more than a racing incident
