the rspca is considering abandoning its controversial policy of ' pursuing pointless fox hunting prosecutions ' after the collapse of the latest case ( file picture of the boxing day hunt in lacock , wiltshire ) the rspca has the power to bring its own prosecutions rather than rely on the police or the crown prosecution service ( crown prosecution service )
the animal charity has no more legal actions left under the hunting act after its decision last month to drop the case against bryer , joint master of the renowned cattistock ( pictured ) in dorset fox hunting with dogs was outlawed in 2005 under tony blair 's government , but groups continue to meet by using trail hunting ( file picture ) however critics claim many of these people are prosecuted under the hunting act for poaching offences , rather than fox hunting , and that hardly any are from official hunts
