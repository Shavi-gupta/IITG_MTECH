the footage shows the two - metre long reptile managing to balance at the top of the pole while swallowing its prey
â goannas , which come from the monitor lizard family , are found throughout most of australia , but it âs unknown where the clip was filmed
the lizard swings its neck back and forth as it battles to swallow the catch , before managing to finish the feat in under a minute goannas can unhinge their lower jaws when feeding , allowing them to dispose of some staggering sized prey including the likes of possums and cats as oppurtunistic feeders , gonannas will eat anything from insects , birds and eggs to mammals like possums and cats
