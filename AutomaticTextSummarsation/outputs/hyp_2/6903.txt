thermal images show copper inside the battery reaching temperatures of at least 1,085 Â° c ( 1,985 â° f ) causing jets of molten material to burst from its vent
copper inside melted , indicating temperatures of at least 1,085 Â° c ( 1,985 Â° f ) , and it caused molten material to stream from the vent ( pictured ) the footage is the first time the failure of li-ion batteries due to overheating has been recorded
a li-ion batteries before being subjected to high temperatures is shown left , the same battery after heat abuse is shown right during tests , one cell remained intact during battery failure and as the heat - generating reactions continued , hot gas followed by molten material jetted out through the battery âs vent ( pictured left to right )
