nestled in eastern long island is a sleepy little town called yaphank where the streets have cozy names like oak and park , names that hide a dark past : they once bore signs like hitler and goebbels streets
in fact , it was largely founded as a nazi camp , one of several scattered across the u.s. , where the children in the german american bund ( aka american nazis ) could fish , swim , hunt and learn about things like eugenics
the german american bund in yaphank , as it did in similar communities in pennsylvania , wisconsin and new jersey , organized military demonstrations where they waved both the u.s. and nazi flags
