thurston , 80 , takes his vessel , dubbed the ' catamavan ' , out on the river swale in kent regularly and enjoys the views of the countryside
bizarre : this ' catamavan ' , a cross between a boat and a caravan , has been spotted on the river swale in kent the catamavan has an oven , fridge freezer , shower , toilet , double bed and two tables , and it is fitted with a small engine that reaches four knots
project : thurston started building the unusual vessel while he was doing through a divorce ' in the swale you get lovely nights and mornings but sometimes it 's a bit cold to sit outside and have a meal so you eat below deck and do n't get any views
