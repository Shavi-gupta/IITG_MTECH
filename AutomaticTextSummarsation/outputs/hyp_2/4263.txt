' boring ' has been the word on everyone 's lips when talking about chelsea this week , but drogba has shown he and his team - mates still have the skill to disprove that disparaging tag
the blues are preparing for wednesday night 's trip to leicester at st george 's park , having drawn criticism for the way they ground out a decisive 0 - 0 draw against arsenal on sunday

' with six players seated opposite each other on either side of a long table , branislav ivanovic throws the ball on to the head of remy to start the game
