while examining species of bacteria that thrive on the fossil fuel deposits deep inside the earth - known as archae - they have found a new type of virus that infects them
this graphic shows how the new archael virus changes uses ' docking tips ' - purple area - to infect bacteria they now believe it may be viruses like this that actually hold the secret that have allowed archae bacteria to adapt to some of the harshest environments on earth
' scientists used submersible alvin ( left ) to obtain sediment samples ( right ) from the the santa monica basin the sea floor , shown above , is covered in microbial mats of primitive bacteria that are infected with viruses the researchers also found that a small genetic element - known as a diversity - generating retroelement - was able to accelerate mutation of a specific part of the virus 's own genome
