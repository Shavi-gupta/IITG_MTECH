an uber customer was hit with a huge $ 16,000 bill for her 7 - mile nightmare journey across new york
jaime hessel said her driver had been on his phone , cut across lanes , and even driven down a bus lane during the 35 minute ' trip from hell ' from her east williamsburg apartment to midtown east
uber has since wiped the bill and offered to pay her the original $ 15 refund but ms hessel said she now feels she ca n't trust them with her new card details
