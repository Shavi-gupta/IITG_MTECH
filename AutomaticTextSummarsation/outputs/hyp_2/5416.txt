should fast food and sugary drink companies be allowed to advertise their junk food to children ? should tv ads promoting unhealthy food and drink be banned until the watershed , or wiped out altogether to save adults ' waistlines too ? a recent survey by the british heart foundation showed two fifths of parents are badgered by their children each week to buy food after seeing it advertised on tv , prompting the charity to deliver a 30,000 strong petition asking the government to ban junk food adverts being shown before the 9pm watershed a recent british heart foundation survey quizzed more than 2,000 parents with children under the age of 16
despite regulation , children in the britain are still being exposed to more tv advertising for unhealthy than healthy food items , even at peak children 's viewing times
the british heart foundation has therefore just delivered a 30,000 strong petition , asking government to ban junk food adverts from being shown before the 9pm watershed , to help protect our children from making unhealthy choices
