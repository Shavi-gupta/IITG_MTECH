a magma chamber beneath the surface is not considered large enough to produce these levels and now researchers have found the source in a secondary magma chamber deeper underground the yellowstone supervolcano is one of the largest active continental silicic volcanic fields in the world
the latest chamber sits 12 to 28 miles ( 19 to 45km ) beneath the surface and measures 11,035 cubic miles ( 46,000 cubic km ) ( illustrated ) to discover the large chamber ( shown in yellow ) , the university of utah tracked seismic waves from 5,000 earthquakes
researchers said the upper magma chamber is believed to have been the source of three yellowstone eruptions 2 million , 1.2 million and 640,000 years ago yellowstone spans the midwestern us states of wyoming , idaho and montana ( pictured ) if yellowstone did erupt , estimates from national geographic suggest its immediate effects would kill around 87,000 instantly
