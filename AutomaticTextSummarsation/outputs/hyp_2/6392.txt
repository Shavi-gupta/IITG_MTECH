but which tipple is the best to bring out the flavour in fiery wasabi peas or salty sausage rolls ? wine experts have created a guide to matching wine with snacks that recommends pairing pinot grigio with nachos and shiraz rose with salt and vinegar crisps
sea salt and balsamic vinegar crisps wine match : shiraz rose why it works : the fresh raspberry and cherry flavours and the hints of spice in the wine work well with the sharpness of the vinegar wasabi peas wine match : chardonnay why it works : the creaminess of the wine takes the heat out of the horseradish in the peas
chocolate wine match : merlot why it works : the softness of the tannins and slight sweet fruit in the back matches really nicely with rich chocolate salted popcorn wine match : sauvignon blanc why it works : the slightly herbaceous , grassy flavours of the sauv blanc match the salty flavours of the pork scratchings gourmet scotch egg wine match : fiano why it works : the fresh flavours of lemongrass and apricot balance well with the hearty and meaty texture of the scotch egg
