jeremy paxman grilled david cameron over the number of zero - hours contracts in the uk workforce but mr miliband told labour activists later today : ' the problem of zero - hours contracts is at the heart of the key question in this election : who does our country work for ? ' does it work just for the rich and the powerful ? or does it work for working people â the people looking for a job , trying to find enough money to support a family , to make ends meet ? ' christian may , of the institute of directors said zero - hours contracts were used by just ' 2 per cent of workers ' which he said could ' hardly be described as an epidemic '
