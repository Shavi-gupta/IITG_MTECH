madrid have n't got going tonight ( i was about to write a post about how barcelona were 5 - 0 up at this point ) but rodriguez produces a bit of individual magic to opening the scoring
and on that note ... madrid : navas , arbeloa , pepe , varane , coentrao , kroos , illarramendi , rodriguez , ronaldo , jese , hernandez subs : iker casillas , marcelo , nacho , lucas silva , isco , martin odegaard , mayoral almeria : ruben , ximo , trujillo , mauro , mane , verza , thomas , corona , dubarbier , hemed , edgar subs : julian , casado , jonathan , sanchez , espinosa , marin , azeez referee : ignacio iglesias villanueva it may only be a home clash against lowly almeria , but tonight could be the biggest night of a 16 - year - old 's life
barcelona hammered getafe 6 - 0 on tuesday to extend their lead at the la liga summit , but madrid will hope to reel in their rivals with victory over a struggling almeria team
