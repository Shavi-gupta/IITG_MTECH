â her friend andrew , pictured , is expected to be put to death on kerobokan prison on tuesday lindsay sandiford was arrested trying to smuggle an estimated Â£ 1.6million worth of cocaine from bangkok into bali she was sentenced to death after indonesian police linked her to almost five kilograms of cocaine in his handwritten letters to lindsay sandiford , andrew jokes about the quality of the food , and describes a meal of butter chicken and naan bread as his â last supper â
lindsay sandiford has been refused funding for an appeal against her sentence by the british government and has rejected consular assistance , in part because of a romance between lindsay sandiford and the british vice-consul to bali , harahap , that led to harahap âs suspension
