lawyers hired by drug rehab network narcocon have argued that trout run , a property in frederick county , maryland , has historic significance because president herbert hoover once caught a fish at the site
narcocon , a scientology - affiliated drug rehab network , is trying to prove that a patch of land near camp david is historic enough so that they can build a center for twelve patients a scientology - back real estate company bought trout run for $ 4.85million in 2013 , and has been trying to change its land designation so that it can build a center that uses saunas and vitamin therapy for addicts narcocon , which uses sauna sessions and the teachings of scientology founder l. ron hubbard , has been sued in the past for wrongful deaths
though narcocon says that it is non-religious and does not try to convert people to scientology , its website features the religion 's founder l. ron hubbard ( pictured ) prominently placing the property on the county register of historic places would allow narconon to conduct its program
