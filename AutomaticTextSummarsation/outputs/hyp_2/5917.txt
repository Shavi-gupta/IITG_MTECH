' tugging at heartstrings : staring with his sad puppy dog eyes into the camera , chester sat with a paw draped over a sign which read : ' why does n't anybody want me ? saying goodbye : saturday morning , volunteers came to the shelter to say good - bye to chester , a longtime favorite among those who 'd come regularly to walk him and give him belly rubs and kisses within a couple of days of the posting , chester was adopted by a family with two sons from new york
