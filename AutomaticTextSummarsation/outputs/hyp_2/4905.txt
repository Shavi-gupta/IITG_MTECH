nguyen was able to fly a chinook , the largest helicopter in the south vietnamese army , with his three young children and wife out of the city and into the south china sea where they were all ultimately saved by the uss kirk
' bravery : nguyen then flew back out to sea ( above ) and jumped from the helicopter safe : he managed to avoid the large amounts of shrapnel ( above ) when the plan crashed heading back : a motorboat soon grabbed him from the sea ( above ) as he wore just a shirt and his boxers the uss kirk however was not large enough to withstand the force of such a large helicopter , which would likely sink the ship and cause the death of everyone onboard
unbelievable : nguyen somehow managed to operate the plane and it 's intricate system ( above ) alone after everyone jumped over : ' it was a happy ending to a shi * * y war , ' said chipman , one of the sailors on the kirk of nguyen 's ( above ) feat that was just the beginning for nguyen though , who now had to start over in united states and try to support his family
