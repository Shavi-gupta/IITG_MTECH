nasa says a white dwarf star - the dense core of a star like the sun that has run out of nuclear fuel - ripped apart a planet at the edge of the milky way galaxy
for example , the gravity at the surface of a white dwarf is over ten thousand times higher than the gravity at the surface of the sun using several telescopes , including nasa 's chandra , researchers have found evidence that a white dwarf star - the dense core of a star like the sun that has run out of nuclear fuel - may have ripped apart a planet as it came too close
the researchers estimate that the destroyed planet would have contained about a third of the mass of earth , while the white dwarf has about 1.4 times the sun 's mass. while the case for the tidal disruption of a planet is not iron - clad , the argument for it was strengthened when astronomers used data from the multiple telescopes to help eliminate other possible explanations for the detected x-rays
