an explosive new report reveals that the americans began secretly tracking phones long before the events of 9/11 or passage of the patriot act
in 1992 , a drug enforcement agency operation which has since been discontinued , monitored every telephone call made from the americans to one of the up to 116 countries on their watch list for drug trafficking , including almost every country in both north and south america
that decision came from attorney general eric holder in september 2013 , just months after edward snowden began systematically releasing classified information he obtained while working at the national security agency , most notably documents that detailed the agency 's reach , which while viewed by some as crucial and necessary , was seen by many as an orwellian nightmare , specifically as it pertained to the freedoms and allowances the agency had been granted when it came to spying on americans
