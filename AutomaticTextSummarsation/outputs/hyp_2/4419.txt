it shows what happens when two supermassive black holes collide the simulation was led by scientists at the university of illinois and included dr roman gold , dr vasileios paschalidis , dr stuart shapiro , dr milton ruiz , dr zachariah etienne , and dr harald pfeiffer
this first simulation shows the gas and magnetic fields as the two supermassive black holes collide this second simulation shows the gravitational waves - ripples in space - time - in the merger material swirls around the objects in a quasar and jets fire out from the poles in the merger
gravitational waves - ripples in space - time caused by such an event â are also predicted to be created by the merger ( illustrated ) , while electromagnetic is blasted into space however , astronomers note that it is not a certainty the observed quasar has two colliding black holes inside it
