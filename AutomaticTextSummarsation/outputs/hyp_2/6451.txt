davion only , 16 , became the face of adoption and an example of all the struggles faced by many teenagers in the system when in 2013 he stood up in a suit and told worshipers at florida 's st mark missionary baptist church ; ' my name is davion and i 've been in foster care since i was born
' millions of people around the country soon head about davion 's story , and the young boy was even interviewed by barbara walters on the view , which all eventually led to him being adopted by a minister in ohio and his family
