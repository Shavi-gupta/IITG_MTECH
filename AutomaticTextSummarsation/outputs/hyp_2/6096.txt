once detached , it whizzes to the ground - taking one and a half minutes to hit the ground the camera continues to record as it spins out of control , and captures some dizzying footage as the camera plummets to the earth , the footage of the free fall becomes even more blurry eventually , the camera crashes into the ground in thick grass - remarkably it remained intact
