seven - year - old briggs was told she can not attend lydgate junior school in sheffield even though she can see it from her bedroom window
unhappy : briggs , seven , was refused a place at a school 150 yards from her home and offered one two miles away , so her mother lynne , pictured together , must quit her job to ensure she gets there and back decision : the schoolgirl leaves across the street from her preferred school but instead will have to head to shooters grove , which is around two miles away mrs briggs had believed broomhill infants school in sheffield , where charlotte is a student , was a feeder school to lydgate junior , so only put one school on charlotte 's admission form
rejected : briggs was refused a place at lydgate junior school ( above ) in sheffield , even though she can see it from her bedroom window ' parents park outside our house when dropping their children off at lydgate juniors
