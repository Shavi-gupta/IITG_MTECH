joly soars like a bird as he leaps from the yacht in brazil waters but the action turns more into a jump than a dive as the water comes nearer it 's feet first on this one as the comedian plunges into the depths earlier , joly said he was a dab hand at diving after being trained in the sport by british 's olympic medallist , tom daley , for tv show splash ! however this jump was more ' tourist abroad ' than diving expert
