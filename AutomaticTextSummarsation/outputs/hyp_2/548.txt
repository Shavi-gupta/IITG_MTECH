cook 's innings into day three in grenada was spot on , particularly the first hour of it cook worked his way to an encouraging 50 but frustratingly was out playing gabriel on for 76 yet it is nonsense to say a batsman who has hit 25 test hundreds can not drive the ball
the england captain hits behind square on the onside as jermaine blackwood ducks for cover cook left the ball outside off stump and made the bowlers come to him , but drove when the option arose he is stronger mentally than anyone he will face , so he just has to carry on showing the same discipline
cook 's off stump is rattled after a wide delivery from gabriel found the inside edge the skipper shows his frustration as his impressive innings to this point is cut short gabriel celebrates after cook 's eyes lit but the ball just lacked pace and he was through the shot too early west indies celebrate the breakthrough but cook can not admonish himself for playing at the delivery cook just has to put that one key statistic to bed and finally reach three figures , then move on with such a big summer ahead
