the video , which surfaced on reddit on monday evening , shows dennis quaid â famed for roles in blockbusters such as wyatt earp , any given sunday and the day after tomorrow â losing the plot after someone appears to wander into his line of sight
' this is the most unprofessional set i have ever been on ! ' cell phone footage has emerged appearing to show actor dennis quaid having a diva-esque meltdown on the set of his latest movie during the 40 seconds or so of footage dennis quaid , the younger brother of fellow actor randy , calls his co-workers unprofessional , zombies and pussies
as one voice off camera tries to calm the actor down , dennis quaid yells , ' do n't f * * king dennis quaid me ' before storming off the set the incident is almost too good to be true and multiple commenters on reddit have speculated that the video is a prank â specifically one orchestrated by late night host jimmy kimmel , who is certainly no stranger to pranks
