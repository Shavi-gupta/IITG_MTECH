â uncanny : niamh geaney , a 26 - year - old student from dublin ( left ) , found her ' twin stranger ' in karen branigan ( right ) , through a social media campaign she launched with friends ' for the entire duration of our encounter i pretty much stared at her
karen branigan ( right ) turned out to be a fellow ireland native who lived just an hour down the road from niamh geaney ( left ) , making it easy for the pair to meet in real life and take some eerily twin - like photos together she added , ' some of the expressions she would pull i would think to myself or say aloud , " oh my god that âs my face " ' while miss niamh geaney appears to have beaten her fellow twin strangers participants , 21 - year - old harry and 22 - year - old terence , hands down , the search is n't over until april 27
