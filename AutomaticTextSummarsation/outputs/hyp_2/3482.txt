ariana miyamoto says it was often punishing growing up as the only black girl in her class in the port town of sasebo near nagasaki , where the us has a naval base and where her african - us father met her japan mother
as a youngster ( right ) she grew up in japan some critics of ariana miyamoto 's win have complained she is a mixed race ' hafu ' and not japan enough but the beauty queen had to use her first television appearance after her selection to apologetically explain to reporters that while she does n't ' look japan ' on the outside , on the inside there are ' many japan things about her '
many in the country have expressed hostility to ariana miyamoto 's title win as they expected the award to go to a ' pure ' japan woman and not a ' hafu ' , meaning half japan , which has echoes of the discredited term ' half - caste '
