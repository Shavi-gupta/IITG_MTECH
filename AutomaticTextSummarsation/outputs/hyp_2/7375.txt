harrowing : taken on the frontline of fighting in the countryside outside the rebel - held city of aleppo , the photos show a prisoner wearing an orange jumpsuit being forced to his knees before being shot the new isis photographs show the activists just moments before he was shot at point blank range images of the media activist 's brutal execution were released by isis ' halab media centre , which operates in and around the city of aleppo and has previously released sickening images and videos of the terror organisation murdering anybody who dares to oppose them
moments from death : with his arms tightly bound behind his back with plastic handcuffs , blurry images show the victim being dragged through a public square by his heavily armed captors strange : isis released the disturbing execution photographs on the same day as they bizarrely attempted to portray everyday life under the terror group 's control as happy and carefree - distributing images of smiling farmers living near aleppo who use western technology to grow and harvest their abundant crops isis leader abu bakr al-baghdadi has been seriously injured in an air strike and is no longer in control of the terrorist group , according to an iraqi source
the happy pastoral scene is in stark contrast to the campaign of rape and massacre isis has brought to vast stretches of the syrian and iraqi - where depraved extremists carry out atrocities in the name of radical islam claim : the news comes as isis leader abu bakr al-baghdadi ( pictured ) was reported to have been seriously injured in an airstrike
