a council has been slammed for ripping up more than 12,000 cobbles from a historic road so it can relay them to make it a smoother surface for cyclists
the council tested the technique on a small patch of paving and said the reaction had been ' overwhelmingly ' in support for the scheme from cyclists , pedestrians and wheelchair users
the cobbles will be lifted from their current place , cut in half and then relaid again to make the surface smoother for cyclists the history of the area dates back to may 1809 when 83 acres of the tidal river avon was impounded to keep ships in the port of bristol afloat at all times
