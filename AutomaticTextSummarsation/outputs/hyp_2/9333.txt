john elder and wegner both documented the unimaginable suffering they witnessed in images which helped build a case against a turkish government which still denies the slaughter of up to 1.5million armenians constituted genocide
as armenians mark 100 years since the atrocities , many western countries still do not use that word , and us president barack obama is once again unlikely to do so in his upcoming statement marking the anniversary despite pledging he would during his election campaign
his images , which along with john elder 's were provided to mailonline by the washington dc - based armenian national institute , still retain the power to shock as the world marks the 100th anniversary of the ' genocide ' today
