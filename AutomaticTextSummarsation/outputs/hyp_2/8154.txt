jamelia has today responded to the furious backlash she is facing after saying that obese women ' should feel uncomfortable ' about their unhealthy size , and that high street stores should not be catering for them
the loose women panellist said she was ' hounded on twitter ' after airing her views on the itv show in a discussion about overweight teenagers , and now insists she was only referring to people larger than a size 20
' janet street porter , 68 , then said : ' i was completely in agreement with jamelia and i said you 've got to ask yourself if a young girl is already size 20 - 25 , can she run around with her children , can she enjoy life or is she storing up health problems for later ? ' so i do feel like jamelia has been somewhat unfairly picked on
