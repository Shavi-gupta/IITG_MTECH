a craig cathcart goal was enough to put watford top of the championship with just two games of the season remaining following a 1 - 0 win over birmingham
they looked as though they would have to settle for second after matt ritchie put bournemouth ahead against sheffield wednesday and on course for top spot , but chris maguire 's stoppage - time penalty at the goldsands stadium denied the cherries and left watford on top of the pile
scotland forward ikechi anya made a huge contribution when he was introduced in the 54th minute having gone in front , watford missed a great chance to double their lead a couple of minutes later when abdi 's floated free - kick picked out the unmarked angella , but he headed over the top
