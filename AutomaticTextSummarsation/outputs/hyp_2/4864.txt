wisden editor booth has launched a stinging attack on the ecb 's handling of kevin pietersen the star batsman will ply his trade for surrey in a bid to reclaim his spot in the test team and he continues : ' a few wins might have deflected attention from a charge sheet that would include the mishandling of the kevin pietersen affair , worrying test attendances outside london , a head in the sand attitude to the one - day team and - not yet a decade after the 2005 ashes had presented english cricket with a golden chance to attract a new generation to the sport â a fall in the number of recreational players
