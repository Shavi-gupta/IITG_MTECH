pietersen scored 170 in his first outing for surrey this season but scored just 19 against glamorgan ' there are a few bridges that still need to be rebuilt , ' said mike gatting , who had just penned a congratulation message to jimmy anderson , england 's leading test wicket - taker , as part of slazenger 's celebratory flag tour
' if people are playing well in the team , why should he just get straight in ? ' pietersen is keen to play for england again after being sacked in 2014 bell and gary ballance both hit centuries in antigua while root also showed signs of good form with scores of 83 and 59
