digital delivery of music caught up with physical formats like cds as a money stream for the first time last year , the trade association ifpi said on tuesday
the report also named the year 's top - selling album - the ' frozen ' soundtrack , which sold 10 million copies , while pharrell williams ' ' happy ' was the top single , selling 13.9 million copies
