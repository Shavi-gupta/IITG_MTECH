the monkeys of northern india 's shimla region have a fearsome reputation - and as this video shows , for a very good reason
footage captured on a cctv camera near an office in shimla , india , shows the playful monkey first jumping onto a ledge to watch pedestrians wander past
what he did n't anticipate was the monkey rearing its tail , bearing its fangs and launching itself at his face - taking him by surprise and sending him sprawling onto his back
