is it heart ruling the head among the man utd faithful ? or is there a genuine belief that serial winner louis van gaal is about to re-assert himself at the very top again ? man utd boss louis van gaal was left frustrated after his side were defeated 1 - 0 by chelsea van gaal poses for pictures with man utd fans at the training ground during a day for the club 's foundation van gaal ( pictured talking to fans ) is starting to assert himself at the man utd after a stuttering start if he is to take man utd back to the very top , he âll need more than memphis depay
obviously van gaal can not win the same number of trophies sir alex picked up during his 27 year reign , so relatively speaking what does he need to achieve to be considered a success at man utd ? sir alex underachieved in europe : only two champions league wins in his time â just one more than liverpool in the same period , and the same number as jose mourinho ( who won those in significantly fewer years )
so what needs to change for man utd to reach that level where they are in the mix to win the premier league and the champions league ? sir alex celebrates his second champions league triumph with man utd in 2008 van gaal celebrates winning the champions league with ajax in 1995 - his only triumph in europe keeping david de gea would be ideal , but valdes has winning experience and there is a bond between the former barcelona keeper and the manager after their time together at the nou camp
