glenn murray ( right ) tormented manchester city at selhurst park as they dropped out of the premier league title race would victory dispel any lingering doubts about van gaal ? quite likely
van gaal has had his critics this season but manchester united 's performances are proving them wrong should kompany remain in the manchester city side ? it would be a big call for a game of such size , but the sense that manchester city may be better off without their captain can not be disregarded
like kompany , yaya toure 's form is patchy but he scored a stunning goal against crystal palace on monday will manchester united solve the problem of angel di maria ? the team looks balanced right now , with ashley young doing nothing to lose his place
