a shocking video has been released showing four tourists they catching a bronzer shark in new zealand , dragging the thrashing creature in to shore and then pose for photos with the creature
andreas rasmussen , christian boyum johansen and johan berg are filmed by emil fogh , standing just centimetres away from the shark they 've captured in an activity that is terrifying but completely legal in new zealand , to the point it has become a competitive sport
the first fisherman is dragged deep into the water from the water 's edge within seconds when the mighty shark takes hold of the end of his line once captured , one person brazenly opens the sharks mouth whilst the other removes the hook the fisherman and his friends whoop with excitement , certain they have achieved their goal : to catch a shark
