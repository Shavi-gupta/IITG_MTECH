manchester city are keen for bayern manager pep guardiola to become their new manager in 2016 pep guardiola cut a frustrated figure as he watched his side lose 3 - 1 at porto in the champions league last week pep guardiola ( right ) speaks with midfielder bastian schweinsteiger during bayern 's training session on monday the 44 - year - old will come under more scrutiny if bayern fail to overturn their quarter - final deficit on tuesday despite winning the premier league last season , manchester city boss manuel pellegrini has come under - fire this term manchester city director of football begiristain ( left ) and pep guardiola enjoyed a successful relationship at barcelona these , however , are peculiar times for both men
pep guardiola is facing his first champions league exit prior to the semi-final stages of his coaching career last season âs 5 - 0 aggregate dismantling at the hands of real madrid is still raw in the minds of bayern bayern doctor hans-wilhelm muller-wohlfahrt ( centre ) quit last week after a reported rift with pep guardiola dante , sebastian rode , lahm and robert lewandowski ( l-r ) trudge off the pitch after defeat in porto pep guardiola â whose team are expected to clinch another bundesliga title this weekend and are in the final of the german cup â has only a year left on his contract at bayern
why , though , would manchester city expect their first team players to work for an interim coach any more than they would a man , manuel pellegrini , who has , after all , won a premier league and league cup during his time in manchester ? it is , sadly , a conundrum , without a clear solution
