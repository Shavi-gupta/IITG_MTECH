hundreds of morning commuters in boston were delayed today after a truck crashed on an elevated highway over subway and rail tracks
the box truck collided with a car on interstate 93 southbound in the city 's dorchester neighborhood at about 6am , and both drivers were taken to hospital with non-life - threatening injuries
commuter woes : as officials did n't want to risk running trains under the over-hanging truck , replacement shuttle buses were run for southbound passengers with long lines forming even after the truck was towed by crane at about 8:30am , traffic remained backed up in both directions
