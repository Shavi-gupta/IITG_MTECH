more than 2,200 walmart employees are now unemployed after the retail corporation announced it was temporarily closing five stores for ' extensive ' plumbing repairs
walmart will put both the full - time and part - time workers affected by the closures on paid leave for two months as they try to transfer to another walmart location
some employees of the pico rivera location ( pictured during a 2013 protest ) believe the store is being closed because it has become a center for protests by workers demanding better wages and benefits walmart recently announced it will raise the store 's minimum hourly wage to $ 9 an hour
