the yoga being taught in a san diego school system is not a gateway to hinduism and does n't violate the religious rights of students or their parents , a california appeals court ruled friday
the 4th district court of appeal in san diego upheld a lower court ruling that tossed out a family 's lawsuit trying to block the encinitas union school district from teaching yoga as an alternative to traditional gym classes
yoga is now taught at schools across the country , but the district is believed to be the first with full - time yoga teachers at all schools
