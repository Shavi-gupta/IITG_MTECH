comedian rik mayall failed to leave a valid will to deal with his Â£ 1.2 million estate , which experts say could leave his family with a large inheritance tax bill
but probate records reveal he had no will â even though he suffered serious head injuries and nearly died in a quad - bike accident in 1998 â which could mean complications for his wife of 29 years , barbara , and their three adult children
kidd , a specialist probate solicitor and partner in south-west london law firm clintons , said that rik mayall âs children would be automatically entitled to a share of his net estate of Â£ 1,192,701 after funeral and legal expenses , meaning they could inherit an amount liable for inheritance tax
