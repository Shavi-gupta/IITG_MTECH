atten - shun ! the three leaders â wives were on parade yesterday , marching across the country in support of their men , in support of the political party into which they married , in support of desperately important employment issues â keeping their idiot husbands in a job
badge on lapel , leaflets in hand , smart white loafers tripping lightly over the hounslow flagstones , she looked every inch the groomed and polished loyal tory wife
today âs wives must wear ordinary high street clothes and nothing that hints at their secret , massive wealth â although samantha cameron âs two hundred quid spotty blouse must have slipped under tory central office radar
