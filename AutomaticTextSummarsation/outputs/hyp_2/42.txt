all eyes will be on ap mccoy as he bids for a dream end to his career but i have a strong feeling that a horse he could have ridden is going to come back to haunt him
the 19 - time champion jockey could have ridden cause of causes who , like his mount shutthefrontdoor , is owned by his boss jp mcmanus
that marks him down as a quality performer , and he is ridden by a grand national winning jockey in paul carberry ( bobbyjo , 1999 ) and trained by a race - winning trainer in gordon elliott ( silver birch , 2007 )
