archaeologists have uncovered a ritual burial of 2,000 - year - old human skulls - sparking the theory they could be the remains of boudicca 's rebels - as the crossrail excavations continue
the latest discovery of cremated human bones packed neatly into a cooking pot and set off at the side of the historic river walbrook , in crossrail , has experts questioning whether they were part of a gruesome ceremony
when about 20 skulls were found buried in clusters in the sediment of the historic tributary in 2013 it had been thought that they had got there down stream after being eroded out of a roman cemetery to the north - but new evidence suggests otherwise
