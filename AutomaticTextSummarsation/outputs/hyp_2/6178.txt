an investigation spanning almost three years into the yearly cost of gun violence covered by americans taxpayers has determined the figure to be over $ 229 billion
the new study , by independent political magazine mother jones , was spawned by the mass shooting in aurora , colorado , in july 2012 during a midnight screening of the dark knight rises , in which 12 people were killed and 70 injured
that figure is more than apple 's annual revenue of $ 174 billion and the cost of the obesity epidemic , which is $ 224 billion the investigation subsequently expanded to account for all the victims of gun - related violence in the americans based on yearly figures from 2012
