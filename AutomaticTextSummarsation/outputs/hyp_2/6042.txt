a two - mile victorian railway line which was shut down 50 years ago under a programme of sweeping closures could reopen as britain 's longest cycle tunnel
the disused rhondda , which runs 1,000 feet beneath the welsh hills , was closed as part of the beeching cutbacks , a project which spelled the end for thousands and stations across the rail network in britain
but engineers are due to visit the 3,148m tunnel next week - for the first time since it closed - to see whether it is safe to use as a cycle route the railway tunnel , which runs beneath the mountains under the dunraven forest in the south wales valleys , was opened in 1890 in the coal boom
