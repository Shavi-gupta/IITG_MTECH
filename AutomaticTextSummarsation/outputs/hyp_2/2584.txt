jack nicklaus recorded his first ever hole - in - one at the masters on wednesday , as camilo villegas fired two in the space of five holes but still could not win the traditional par - three contest
villegas holed out on the fourth and eighth as he finished alongside kevin streelman on five under par , only to find water on the eighth when he played it again as the third play - off hole
kevin streelman holds his trophy aloft after winning the par-3 contest on a play - off against camilo villegas kevin streelman therefore became the latest player to be saddled with the ' curse ' of the par - three champion , with no player ever becoming par - three and masters champion in the same year
