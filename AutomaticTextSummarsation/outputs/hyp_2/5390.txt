st george 's county asylum first opened in 1818 and once housed nearly 1,000 patients run down : shattered doors , overturned bathtubs and crumbling floors dominate the grade ii listed st george 's county asylum in stafford empty room : the asylum was initially large enough for 120 patients but between 1879 and 1884 two extra wings were added
the project is planned for completion by early 2017 beyond repair : director of property developer shropshire homes , howard thorne , said parts of the asylum being demolished were ' structurally unsound ' and that it was impossible for them to be preserved going back in time : st george 's county asylum , which was renamed st george âs hospital in 1937 , was built at a time when pauper asylums were being constructed nationwide
