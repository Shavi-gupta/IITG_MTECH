this combines with the existing 11 - year solar cycle , causing even more powerful coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) , pictured , and solar flares that can endanger earth the study was carried out by a team of researchers led by the ncar ( ncar ) in colorado
the new solar season occurs when twisted , ring - shaped ' bands ' of magnetic field rise from the solar interior and pass to the surface through the tachocline - a ' transition ' region in the outer third of the sun. ' much like earth 's jet stream , whose warps and waves have had severe impact on our regional weather patterns in the past couple of winters , the bands on the sun have very slow - moving waves that can expand and warp it too , ' said co-author dr robert leamon , a scientist at montana state university
the new solar season discovery occurs when twisted , ring - shaped ' bands ' of magnetic field rise from the solar interior and pass to the surface through the tachocline - a ' transition ' region in the outer third of the sun. shown in this illustration are the various different regions of the sun and a sunspot ( top right ) the bands , which appear in each hemisphere of the sun , cause the 11 - year solar cycle to actually become a longer cycle that lasts 22 years
