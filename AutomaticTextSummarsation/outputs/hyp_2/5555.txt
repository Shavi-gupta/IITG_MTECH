murray , from brisbane in queensland , recently spent months travelling across the americans , and documented his interactions with locals all around the country
from a homeless man who was insistent upon telling his story about britney spears , to a man who insisted murray was saying ' get out of my nightgown ' , the filmmaker captured it all
kids giggled as they tried to understand what murray was saying in his australian accent many times the filmmaker was met with strange glances from confused americans children were n't much better and translating the popular australian phrase , but the best of the bunch came from a shirtless man in austin , texas
