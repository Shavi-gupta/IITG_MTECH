two prototypes of the cyg-11 were tested this week over the sea off the coast of haikou in hainan province in china
the cyg-11 seaplane ( above ) uses reduced drag and increased lift from wing - in - ground effect to glide the vehicles takes advantage of an aerodynamic phenomenon known as the wing - in - ground effect - where lift is increased and drag decreased when an aircraft 's wings are close to the ground
the hainan yingge wing in ground effect craft manufacturing company tested two prototypes of the plane the prototypes are designed to carry two pilots ( above ) and 10 passengers but larger craft are in development the plane can be used like a catamaran initially until it builds up enough speed to lift off from the ocean it says the aircraft could find uses for coastal defence , customs patrols and perhaps even be used as the public transport of the future along ' marine highways '
