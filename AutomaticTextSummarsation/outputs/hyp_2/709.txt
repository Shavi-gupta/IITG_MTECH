if benny and bjorn actually laboured under this surrendering misapprehension when they wrote their song ( songwriters are not hot on facts â happy to say anything as long as it rhymes ) , they would have discovered the truth when they subsequently paid a visit to the wellington museum in waterloo , just south of brussels in belgian
view of hougoumont from the lion 's mound or lion 's mound on the battlefield of waterloo , belgian judging by the photo of abba âs visit , prominently on view in the museum , the group seems to have been treated to a rapturous limousine procession through the town
it is unfortunate for anniversary - celebrating purposes that waterloo lies in the french half where the locals are preparing to mark the bicentenary of the waterloo â with napoleon as the unchallenged star of the show
