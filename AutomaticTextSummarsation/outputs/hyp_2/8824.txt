sorry state : a dog who went missing more than a year ago has been reunited with her owners after being rescued from peril during a cockfighting bust in south carolina ( above ) missing : april morris of bennettsville , thought she âd never see her beloved pit bull , nina louise , ( above ) again after she went astray in december 2013 - months of searching and a $ 500 cash reward proved fruitless but this past saturday she could n't believe her eyes when she saw footage of the pup 's rescue on the nightly news - she was even more surprised when the bulletin revealed the canine had just given birth to ten pups ' it seems so surreal to us
in safe hands : nina louise is now back at home with her family where she is being nursed back to health brood : her puppies , who have all found adoptive homes , will remain with her until they have stopped nursing
