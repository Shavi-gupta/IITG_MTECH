the queen 's guard ( pictured ) slipped on a manhole cover during the popular changing of the guard at buckingham palace last week
tourist david meadwell shot this footage of the changing of the guard last week when the incident unfolded the moment it all started to go wrong : the guard leans heavily to the side as he appears to slip the unidentified young guard 's legs appear to get a bit tangled as he tries to turn to march away the guard , wearing full regalia , falls heavily to the floor still clutching his rifle following the slip up ' the first group changed successfully , without any problems , and so i decided to video the next group doing it
