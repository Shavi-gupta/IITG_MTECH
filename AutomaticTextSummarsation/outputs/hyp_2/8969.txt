lewandowski returned to haunt his former club as bayern munich earned a narrow victory against dortmund at the signal iduna park on saturday
poland international lewandowski scored the winner on his first visit back to the club he left on a free transfer last summer as pep guardiola 's side restored their 10 - point lead at the top of the bundesliga
former manchester united midfielder kagawa or mkhitaryan will surely feature in the second half if dortmund 's current attacking players fail to cancel out lewandowski 's opener
