a union conference heard today that schools are struggling to cope with an influx of children arriving unable to speak english - forcing some teachers to use google translate to make lesson plans in other languages they also said english - speaking children are not getting their â fair share â of attention from teachers because of the additional needs of those from abroad
teachers have warned that schools are now having to deal with pupils across the uk speaking up to 300 different languages - but hardly any english she said that it was even harder to deal with those who had â complex needs â such as communication disorders , autism and moderate learning difficulties if they also had poor english skills
